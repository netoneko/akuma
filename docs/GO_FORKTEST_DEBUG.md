# Go Forktest Crash Analysis

This document details two distinct crash patterns observed when running `forktest_parent --combined_stress` on Akuma OS. The crashes manifest as `addr=0x2` segmentation faults in Go's memory allocator.

## Test Command

```bash
MEMORY=2048M cargo run --release
# Then via SSH:
cd /bin && forktest_parent --duration 10s --combined_stress
```

## Crash Pattern 1: Child Process Heap Corruption

### Symptoms

```
panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference
[signal SIGSEGV: segmentation violation code=0x1 addr=0x2 pc=0x86768]

goroutine 10 [running]:
main.runMmapStress(...)
runtime.memclrNoHeapPointers()
  .../memclr_arm64.s:91 +0xb8
runtime.mallocgcLarge(...)
  .../malloc.go:1612 +0x1a8
```

### Kernel Log Evidence

```
[DA-MISS] pid=96 ppid=90 va=0x2 lr_count=14 parent_lr=13 parent_has_va=false
[WILD-DA] pid=96 FAR=0x2 ELR=0x86768 last_sc=18446744073709551615
```

### Analysis

- **Fault address**: `0x2` is NOT a valid memory address - it's a corrupted pointer value
- **PC=0x86768**: Crash occurs in `memclrNoHeapPointers` (Go's memory zeroing routine)
- **Call chain**: `make([]byte, N)` → `mallocgc` → `mallocgcLarge` → `memclrNoHeapPointers`
- **`last_sc=!0u64`**: No syscall was active - crash is purely in userspace
- **Implication**: Go's `mallocgc` returned `0x2` instead of a valid heap pointer

## Crash Pattern 2: Parent Process Heap Corruption

### Symptoms

```
SIGSEGV: segmentation violation
PC=0x13060 m=0 sigcode=1 addr=0x2

goroutine 1 [syscall]:
syscall.Syscall(0x3f, 0x4, 0x1e0087718, 0x400)  // read() syscall
```

### Kernel Log Evidence

```
[DA-MISS] pid=90 ppid=0 va=0x2 lr_count=13 parent_lr=0 parent_has_va=false
[WILD-DA] pid=90 FAR=0x2 ELR=0x13060 last_sc=18446744073709551615
```

### Analysis

- **Same `addr=0x2`**: Identical corrupted pointer pattern
- **PC=0x13060**: In Go's syscall return trampoline
- **Context**: Parent was reading from a pipe (fd=4) monitoring children
- **Timing**: Often occurs after child crashes, but sometimes independently

## The `0x2` Value

The value `0x2` is suspicious because:

1. It's too small to be a valid heap pointer (Go heap starts at ~0x1e000_0000)
2. It's not NULL (0x0) which would indicate a clear nil pointer
3. It appears in both parent and child processes
4. It suggests corruption of Go's span/mheap data structures

Possible sources of `0x2`:
- A corrupted `mspan.base` pointer
- A freed/recycled span that still contains stale metadata
- A race condition leaving partial pointer values

## Verified Non-Issues

### clock_gettime Syscall

The `[EFAULT] nr=113` log entry appearing before crashes was investigated. Analysis showed:
- The args `[0x1e0a7aff0, 0x4fc0, ...]` indicate garbage register state, not a real syscall
- `clock_gettime` implementation is Linux-compatible (verified with 8 kernel tests)
- The EFAULT was from boot tests, not runtime crashes

Tests added:
- `test_clock_gettime_struct_layout` - Verifies `struct timespec` matches Linux ABI
- `test_clock_gettime_realtime` - CLOCK_REALTIME returns valid time
- `test_clock_gettime_monotonic` - CLOCK_MONOTONIC never goes backwards
- `test_clock_gettime_all_clock_ids` - All clock IDs accepted
- `test_clock_gettime_efault_null_ptr` - NULL pointer returns EFAULT
- `test_clock_gettime_efault_invalid_ptr` - Invalid pointer returns EFAULT
- `test_clock_getres_basic` - Resolution query works
- `test_clock_getres_null_ptr` - NULL res pointer allowed (Linux compat)

### Sigaltstack Handling

Sigaltstack handling was verified:
- `clone_thread` creates new M-threads with `alt_sp=0x0` (correct)
- Forked processes inherit sigaltstack from parent (correct for fork semantics)
- SIGURG guard in `entry_point_trampoline` clears pending signals for uninitialized threads

## Theories to Investigate

### Theory 1: CoW Page Fault Race Condition

**Hypothesis**: When multiple Go M-threads fault on the same CoW page simultaneously, the page fault handler may corrupt allocator metadata.

**Evidence**:
- Crashes occur in multi-threaded Go processes
- `CLONE_VM` threads share address space
- Go's heap spans cross page boundaries

**Investigation steps**:
1. Add logging to `handle_cow_fault()` when Go heap pages are duplicated
2. Check for lock contention in CoW fault handling
3. Verify TLB invalidation is correct for all CPUs/threads

### Theory 2: Demand Paging Race in Lazy Regions

**Hypothesis**: The `LAZY_REGION_TABLE` operations have a race condition when multiple threads fault on the same lazy region.

**Evidence**:
- Go allocates large lazy regions (e.g., `mmap 0x6400000` = 100MB)
- Multiple M-threads can fault on different pages within the same region
- The region lookup and physical page allocation may not be fully atomic

**Investigation steps**:
1. Add per-region locks for demand paging
2. Log when two threads fault on the same region simultaneously
3. Verify physical page is correctly mapped for all faulting threads

### Theory 3: Process/Thread Address Space Confusion

**Hypothesis**: With `CLONE_VM` threads, the address-space owner PID tracking has edge cases that cause wrong page tables to be used.

**Evidence**:
- Lazy regions are keyed by "address-space owner PID"
- Thread groups share address space via `CLONE_VM`
- The `find_process_info_page_owner` function may return wrong PID in some cases

**Investigation steps**:
1. Log PID used for lazy region lookups vs actual thread's PID
2. Verify TTBR0 (page table base) is consistent across all threads in a group
3. Check if terminated threads' PIDs are incorrectly reused

### Theory 4: OOM Handling Corrupts Allocator State

**Hypothesis**: When physical memory runs low (OOM), the kernel's error handling corrupts Go's heap state.

**Evidence**:
- With 256MB RAM, `[DA-DP] ... anon alloc failed, 0 free pages` appears
- OOM handling may return error codes that Go misinterprets as pointers
- Even with 2GB RAM, memory pressure from multiple children could trigger edge cases

**Investigation steps**:
1. Run with `MEMORY=4096M` to eliminate OOM entirely
2. Add logging when demand paging fails due to OOM
3. Verify mmap failure returns correct -ENOMEM to userspace

### Theory 5: Signal Delivery During Allocation

**Hypothesis**: SIGURG for goroutine preemption arrives during `mallocgc` critical section, corrupting allocator state.

**Evidence**:
- Go sends SIGURG to M-threads for preemption
- `mallocgc` is complex with multiple internal data structures
- Go's allocator should be signal-safe since Go 1.14, but kernel-level signal delivery differs

**Investigation steps**:
1. Log all SIGURG deliveries with PC at delivery time
2. Check if any SIGURG arrives while PC is in `mallocgc` range
3. Test with `GODEBUG=asyncpreemptoff=1` to disable preemption signals

## Diagnostic Commands

```bash
grep -E "clone_thread|TRAMP.*alt_sp" /tmp/akuma_output.txt
```

### Check memory state:

grep -E "DA-DP|anon alloc failed|free pages" /tmp/akuma_output.txt
```

### Check signal delivery:

```

## Test Isolation Ideas

1. **Single M-thread**: Run with `GOMAXPROCS=1` - if crashes disappear, confirms multi-threading issue

2. **No forking**: Run child directly without fork - isolates fork/CoW from thread creation

3. **Simple allocations**: Modify `runMmapStress` to use smaller allocations - checks if large allocations trigger the bug

4. **Disable preemption**: Build Go binary with `GODEBUG=asyncpreemptoff=1` - eliminates SIGURG as a factor

## Summary

Both crash patterns show `addr=0x2` which indicates Go's heap allocator is returning corrupted pointers. The corruption likely originates from:

1. A race condition in the kernel's handling of shared memory (CoW or demand paging)
2. Incorrect address-space management for `CLONE_VM` thread groups
3. Signal delivery timing issues during allocation

The most promising investigation paths are:
1. Add locking/logging to CoW fault handler
2. Verify `LAZY_REGION_TABLE` operations are atomic
3. Test with `GOMAXPROCS=1` to confirm multi-threading involvement
