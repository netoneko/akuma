# Akuma Self-Hosting — compiling the kernel inside Akuma

This documents how to build the Akuma kernel **with `rustc` running inside Akuma
itself**, the prerequisites that make it possible, and the kernel changes that
were needed to give the build enough RAM.

It is the reference companion to the runnable playbook
[`acceptance/10_selfhost_compile_akuma.md`](../acceptance/10_selfhost_compile_akuma.md).
The single-file bring-up that preceded it (`rustc hello.rs`) is in
[`docs/RUST_TOOLCHAIN.md`](RUST_TOOLCHAIN.md).

---

## 1. Prerequisites

### 1.1 A nightly, musl-host Rust toolchain

Two hard constraints decide the toolchain:

1. **Nightly is mandatory.** The root `Cargo.toml` opens with
   `cargo-features = ["panic-immediate-abort"]`. That is a *nightly cargo*
   feature, so **any** cargo invocation on stable fails at manifest-parse time —
   Alpine's apk `rust` (stable 1.91) cannot even read the workspace. The build
   must use a nightly `cargo`/`rustc`.

2. **The host must be `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`.** Akuma's userspace is musl;
   a glibc `rustc` binary would not run (no glibc loader). Nightly *does* ship a
   musl-host toolchain — verified present on `static.rust-lang.org`:
   `rustc`, `cargo`, and `rust-std` for `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`.

### 1.2 What a `--release` kernel build actually needs

| Component | Needed for `cargo build --release`? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| nightly `rustc` + `cargo` (musl host) | **yes** | nightly cargo-feature + the codegen/link |
| `rust-std` for `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` | **yes** | compiling/running `build.rs` and proc-macros (host artifacts) |
| `rust-std` for `aarch64-unknown-none` | **yes** | the kernel's target; `profile.release` = `panic="abort"` links against the **precompiled** target std — **no `build-std`** |
| `rust-src` | no (release) / **yes** for `size`/`extreme` | those profiles are `panic="immediate-abort"` → need `-Z build-std` |
| C toolchain (`clang`, `ld.lld`, `gcc`, `cc`, `ar`, `make`) | recommended | `cc`-rs build scripts; the kernel link itself uses bundled `rust-lld` |

So the realistic self-host target is **`cargo build --release`**: it does *not*
need `build-std`, only the precompiled `aarch64-unknown-none` std.

### 1.3 Dependencies (offline)

Building the workspace pulls ~real crates from crates.io plus one git fork
(`embedded-tls`). **cargo-over-TLS inside Akuma works** — proven June 2026 by an
in-VM `cargo build` of the `userspace/hello` crate, which fetched all its deps
(`format_no_std`, `talc`, `lock_api`, `scopeguard`) from `index.crates.io`/
`static.crates.io` over HTTPS into `/root/.cargo/registry` (§7d). TLS/HTTPS is
already used elsewhere in Akuma (apk-over-TLS, in-kernel SSH), so this was expected.
Vendoring (`cargo vendor`, point `.cargo/config.toml` at `vendored-sources`) is
therefore optional — a way to make the build fully offline/deterministic, not a
requirement.

### 1.4 RAM

`rustc` needed ≥2 GB just for `hello.rs`. A self-host build runs hundreds of
`rustc` invocations and Akuma's `fork` CoW is heavy (see
`docs/RUST_TOOLCHAIN.md` §5b), so give the VM as much as it can take. The kernel
now boots and runs at **`MEMORY` up to 16 GB** (§3); use `-j1` to bound peak
footprint while probing.

### 1.5 Disk

An ext2 image with the toolchain (~1 GB) + the source + room for `target/`.
8 GB is comfortable.

---

## 2. Preparing the disk (host side)

A new `--with-rust-toolchain` flag on `scripts/populate_disk.sh` installs the
nightly musl-host toolchain into the image via Docker (no waiting inside Akuma),
and a `DISK` env override on both disk scripts lets you build a separate image
without touching the primary `disk.img`.

```bash
# 1. 8 GB image, separate from the primary disk.img
DISK=disk_selfhost.img bash scripts/create_disk.sh 8192

# 2. bootstrap + busybox + musl-dev + the nightly Rust toolchain
DISK=disk_selfhost.img bash scripts/populate_disk.sh \
    --with-apk --with-musl-dev --with-rust-toolchain

# 3. put the akuma source in the image (git clone, or the offline-vendored
#    staging described in acceptance/10) at /root/akuma
```

`--with-rust-toolchain` downloads (from `static.rust-lang.org`) and installs under
`/usr/local`: `rustc`, `cargo`, host + `aarch64-unknown-none` `rust-std`, and
`rust-src`; it also apk-installs the C toolchain. Implementation notes that bit
during bring-up: busybox `tar -J` corrupts these large `.xz` streams (decompress
with the real `xz` binary and pipe to `tar`), and the rust `install.sh` needs
`bash` (Alpine ships only busybox `sh`).

See `acceptance/10_selfhost_compile_akuma.md` for the exact, copy-pasteable
preparation and the in-VM build steps.

---

## 3. Giving the build more RAM: the 6 GB → 16 GB story

### Symptom

Booting `MEMORY=8192` (8 GB) crashed in the **boot self-test suite**:

```
[TEST] map_user_page: map → verify → unmap → verify
[Exception] Sync from EL1: EC=0x25, ISS=0x7
  ELR=0x40336a4c, FAR=0x1c0180000          # FAR ≈ 7 GB
  EC=0x25 in kernel code — killing current process (EFAULT)
[SCHED] WARNING: yield_now with IRQs masked tid=0 ...   # boot thread dead → spin
```

`MEMORY` up to 6 GB was fine; ≥ ~7 GB crashed.

### Root cause — a boot self-test VA collision (not a kernel limit)

The MEMORY>2GB work (`docs/MEMORY_LAYOUT.md`) made the kernel/user VA split track
detected RAM: `kernel_va_end()` = `round_up(ram_base + ram_size, 1GB)`, and the
boot identity map is extended with 1 GB blocks to cover all RAM. Real user
processes are unaffected — `alloc_mmap` jumps over `[KERNEL_VA_START, kernel_va_end)`
to place user VAs above the (now larger) identity window.

But three boot self-tests in `src/tests.rs`
(`test_map_user_page_roundtrip`, `_preserves_irq_state`, `_race_leaks_frame`)
hardcoded a scratch VA of ~7.5–7.75 GB (`0x1_E000_0000` / `0x1_F000_0000`). That
is a safe "high user VA" only while RAM ≲ 7 GB. Once RAM is large enough that the
identity map *reaches* that address (MEMORY ≥ 8 GB), the scratch VA lands **inside
a 1 GB identity block**. `map_user_page` then tries to split that block into
L2/L3 tables and allocates the new page-table frames from the very 1 GB region it
just unmapped — so writing into a fresh table faults (translation fault, the
`FAR ≈ 7 GB`). The boot thread (tid 0) is killed and the scheduler spins.

### Fix

Move the three scratch VAs **above** the RAM identity map, matching the
convention the other PTE-walk tests already use (256 GB+, e.g.
`0x40_C000_0000`):

| test | old VA | new VA |
|---|---|---|
| `test_map_user_page_roundtrip` | `0x1_F000_0000` (7.75 GB) | `0x41_0000_0000` (260 GB) |
| `test_map_user_page_preserves_irq_state` | `0x1_E000_0000` (7.5 GB) | `0x41_4000_0000` (261 GB) |
| `test_map_user_page_race_leaks_frame` | `0x1_E000_0000` (7.5 GB) | `0x41_8000_0000` (262 GB) |

256 GB+ is above any plausible RAM identity map, so `map_user_page` builds fresh
tables under an empty L1 entry (no block to split) and the page-table frames it
allocates live in identity-mapped RAM. This was a **test bug**, not a kernel
capability limit — actual user mappings already worked at large RAM.

### Verified boot matrix

`scripts/boot_ram_sweep.sh` boots the release kernel at each size and checks it
reaches the in-kernel SSH server. (It must `grep -a` the logs: QEMU/HVF output
carries a stray control byte that makes plain `grep` treat the log as binary and
silently never match — this produced a false "all FAIL" the first time.)

Result (release kernel, `disk_selfhost.img`, HVF, June 2026 — after the test-VA fix):

| `MEMORY` | DTB-detected | boot → SSH |
|---|---|---|
| 6144M (6 GB)  | 6144 MB  | ✅ PASS |
| 8192M (8 GB)  | 8192 MB  | ✅ PASS  *(was the `map_user_page` crash; fixed)* |
| 10240M (10 GB)| 10240 MB | ✅ PASS |
| 12288M (12 GB)| 12288 MB | ✅ PASS |
| 14336M (14 GB)| 14336 MB | ✅ PASS |
| 16384M (16 GB)| 16384 MB | ✅ PASS |

All six detect the full RAM and reach `[SSH Server] Listening...`. Free RAM scales
with `MEMORY` (e.g. at 8 GB the PMM idles at ~1.90M / 2.10M pages free ≈ 7.2 GB
free). 16 GB was the top of the sweep, not a new ceiling — the boot map covers
1 GB blocks up to L1[511] (≈512 GB), so the architectural limit is far higher; the
practical limit is host RAM (this host: 48 GB).

---

## 4. Does the nightly toolchain actually run inside Akuma?

Yes, up to a point. Findings (June 2026, `disk_selfhost.img`, nightly
`rustc 1.98.0-nightly (9e2abe0c6 2026-06-16)`, host musl):

| Operation | Result |
|---|---|
| `rustc --version` | ✅ works at **every** `MEMORY` = 4/6/8/10/12/16 GB (`scripts/rustc_ram_sweep.sh`). Not RAM-capped. |
| `rustc --emit=obj hello.rs` (codegen only, **no linker**) | ✅ **completes**, produces a valid ELF `.o` (6344 B, magic `7f45 4c46`). ~24 s warm at 16 GB. |
| `rustc hello.rs -o hello` (codegen **+ link**) | ❌ **does not complete** — the link step kills the session (see §6). 0-byte output. |

So **codegen works end-to-end**; the original wall was the **link step** — fixed
in §5.

---

## 5. The link step: stdin-EOF was killing the session (FIXED)

`rustc hello.rs -o hello` *does* link inside Akuma (the chain
`rustc` → `cc` → `collect2` → `execve …/bin/ld` is visible in the kernel log).
It is slow — rustc forks to spawn the linker, and that fork CoW-shares rustc's
~75k-page address space (libLLVM); on single-core QEMU it runs tens of seconds
(`docs/RUST_TOOLCHAIN.md` §5b, `docs/COW_OPTIMIZATIONS.md`). But slow is fine. The
*blocker* was a session bug, not throughput:

**Root cause.** `ssh host cmd` closes its stdin immediately (sends
`SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_EOF`). `src/shell/mod.rs` treated that EOF as a disconnect and
**interrupted the foreground process** (a band-aid for an `exec cat` hang, issue
#5 in `docs/STABILITY_URGENT_ISSUES.md`). So every long non-interactive command
was cut at its first idle moment; the build then ran orphaned (which is why a
binary sometimes appeared if you polled long enough) but the session and its
streamed output were gone. Confirmed: the drop fired at stdin-EOF (14–59 s), far
under the 60 s read / 300 s idle timeouts — **never a timeout.**

**Fix (commit on this branch).** Split `channel_eof` (stdin done) from
`channel_closed` (real `CHANNEL_CLOSE` / `DISCONNECT` / TCP-EOF) in
`crates/akuma-ssh` + `src/ssh/protocol.rs`, and in the streaming loop
(`src/shell/mod.rs`):

- **stdin-EOF** → `process::close_process_stdin(pid)` (deliver EOF to the process
  so stdin-readers finish) and **keep streaming** until the process exits;
- **real disconnect** → deliver stdin-EOF then stop streaming, but **leave the
  process running** (orphaned, reattachable via `box grab`) — disconnecting does
  *not* kill it;
- **Ctrl-C (0x03)** → still the explicit kill.

A `close_process_stdin` that didn't wake a parked reader exposed a **lost-wakeup
race** in `read(stdin)` (`src/syscall/fs.rs`): the reader checked
`is_stdin_closed()`, *then* registered its waker, so a close in that window
parked it forever. Fixed by re-checking after registering the waker. Guards:
`test_channel_eof_distinct_from_close`, `test_streaming_exec_survives_stdin_eof`
(`src/ssh_tests.rs`).

**Result:** `ssh host '<build>'` now stays connected for the whole compile and
returns the artifact. Verified repeatedly: nightly `rustc -C linker=clang
hello.rs` holds the session ~120 s and the binary runs; apk rustc ~70 s.

### Mini-shell constraints (still true, useful to know)

| Want | Reality |
|---|---|
| `cmd &` (background) | ❌ `&` is passed as an argument |
| `busybox sh -c '…'` / `sh script.sh` | ❌ forking rustc from busybox `sh` **segfaults rustc** |
| `#!/bin/sh` wrapper script | ❌ `execve` doesn't honor shebang → `exit 127` |
| `2>file` (stderr redirect) | ❌ unsupported; `2` leaks as an arg. Only `>file` works |
| `busybox env VAR=… cmd` | ✅ sets env + `execve`s — use this to give rustc a `PATH` |

To compile inside the VM today: `/bin/busybox env PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
HOME=/root /usr/local/bin/rustc -C linker=clang /root/hello.rs -o /root/hello`,
then run `/root/hello`.

---

## 6. Benchmarks (hello.rs)

`hello.rs` = `fn main(){ println!("Hello from Akuma!"); }`. Compile, then run.

| Environment | Toolchain | compile | runs? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Mac native** (Apple Silicon) | rustc 1.95.0 | debug 0.67 s / `-O` 0.13 s | ✅ |
| **Docker Alpine** arm64 (native musl) | rustc 1.91.1 (apk) | debug 0.05 s / `-O` 0.04 s | ✅ |
| **Akuma 16 GB** — codegen only (`--emit=obj`) | nightly 1.98 | ~24 s | (.o) |
| **Akuma 16 GB** — full compile + link (apk) | apk 1.96 | **~70 s** | ✅ runs |
| **Akuma 16 GB** — full compile + link (nightly) | nightly 1.98 | **~120 s** | ✅ runs |

Akuma is **~150–1000× slower** than native — dominated by demand-paging the
305 MB `librustc_driver.so` + libLLVM off virtio-blk and the slow link-fork
(§5b). A single dependency-free `hello.rs` now compiles, links, and runs over one
SSH session.

> **TODO (still open):** (a) compile+run hello.rs across `MEMORY` 4→16 GB with
> timings, (b) find the RAM floor counting down from 1.5 GB, (c) tabulate vs
> Mac/Docker. `scripts/rustc_ram_sweep.sh` already boots each size and runs a
> probe — extend it to compile + run + time now that the link completes.

---

## 7. Future ideas (built-in shell / userspace gaps)

Surfaced while bringing up the toolchain — none block self-hosting, but each is a
papercut that "everyone expects" to work:

- **Split stdout / stderr.** The mini-shell only honors `>` (stdout); `2>` leaks
  `2` as an argument and `2>&1` is unsupported. Real shells separate the streams —
  needed for `cmd 2>err.log` and for tools that distinguish the two. Today rustc's
  errors can only be read off the live stderr channel on fast commands.
- **`/dev/null`.** No null device, so the common `… 2>/dev/null` / `> /dev/null`
  idioms don't work. Add a `/dev` null (and `/dev/zero`) device node.
- **`ln` in the built-in shell.** No link command; symlinks/hardlinks must be
  created out-of-band (host-side `populate_disk`). A built-in `ln`/`ln -s` would
  let in-VM setup (e.g. toolchain shims) be scripted.
- **Interactive stdin-readers over `ssh host cmd`.** With the §5 fix a
  stdin-reader (e.g. `cat`) exits cleanly when the client *sends* `CHANNEL_EOF`
  (piped input) or on real disconnect, but non-interactive `ssh host cat` where
  the client never signals EOF still just waits — and `CHANNEL_EOF`/`CHANNEL_DATA`
  delivery while the reader is parked is occasionally flaky. The canonical-mode
  stdin path could use a hardening pass.
- **A detached build runner.** `box use -d` + `box grab` exist (grab re-streams
  live output) but "log persistence while detached" is TBD. With the §5 fix the
  session survives a build, so this is now optional, but it'd make long
  multi-crate builds robust to client drops.
- ~~**Fix all clippy warnings in the kernel (`src/`).**~~ **DONE (June 2026).** Both
  the kernel crate and all workspace crates now pass clippy clean. The kernel is
  included in the pre-commit gate alongside the crates.
- ~~**Clean up `userspace/libakuma` warnings + clippy.**~~ **DONE (June 2026).** The
  userspace workspace (libakuma + all linked crates) is now warning-free and passes
  a `-D warnings` clippy pass, so in-VM self-host builds of userspace are clean.
- **Housekeeping: drop `sshd` and `needle-server` from the userspace workspace.**
  Candidates for removal from `userspace/Cargo.toml` `members` to slim the
  self-host build surface (`sshd` is the lone `net-async` consumer; revisit whether
  either is still needed in-tree).
- **Build a full pthreads / threading-API conformance test set.** The §7k.3
  per-thread-signal-mask bug went undetected for a long time because nothing
  exercised the threading/signal API the way a real multi-threaded program
  (rustc/rayon) does — it only surfaced as an intermittent self-host crash. A
  dedicated test set would catch this whole class up front. Cover, as standalone
  userspace binaries (cross-built musl/aarch64 and staged on the disk) **and** as
  boot self-tests where feasible:
  - **Per-thread signal mask** — `pthread_sigmask`/`rt_sigprocmask` is per-thread:
    one thread's BLOCK/UNBLOCK/SETMASK must not affect a sibling; mask survives a
    signal-handler round-trip; a recycled thread slot starts with an empty mask; a
    cloned thread inherits the creator's mask. (This is the exact §7k.3 regression.)
  - **`pthread_create`/`join`/`detach`** — many threads, fan-out/fan-in, return
    values, joinable vs detached, TLS (`tpidr_el0`) isolation per thread.
  - **`pthread_mutex`/`cond`/`rwlock`/`barrier`/`once`/`spinlock`** — contention,
    timed waits, broadcast, recursive/errorcheck mutexes (all futex-backed: stresses
    `FUTEX_WAIT`/`WAKE`/`REQUEUE`/`WAIT_BITSET`/`CLOCK_REALTIME`).
  - **Signals × threads** — `pthread_kill`/`tgkill` targeting a specific tid; async
    delivery at arbitrary PCs (not just syscall stubs) with register-integrity
    assertions across delivery+`sigreturn`; `sigaltstack` per thread; nested/
    re-entrant delivery; fatal-signal → whole-group `exit_group`.
  - **Cancellation, `pthread_atfork`, `pthread_key_*` (TSD with destructors).**
  A `userspace/pthread_suite/` that prints `ALL PASSED`/`exit 0`, plus the targeted
  register-integrity-under-signal-storm check, would have caught §7k.3 directly and
  guards the cluster vision's multi-VM concurrency bar.
- **In-VM `git` is broken for pulling — fix it.** Two separate problems block
  `git pull` of a branch into the on-disk `/root/akuma` (June 2026):
  1. **`git-remote-https` (apk git 2.54) SIGSEGVs** — `git fetch` over https dies
     with `git-remote-https died of signal 11`; the kernel log shows a wild
     instruction-abort (`[WILD-IA] ELR=0x0`, jump to null) in the helper. So
     git-over-https fails *even though cargo-over-https works* — different HTTP
     client (libcurl vs cargo's). Likely the same exec/relocation corruption class
     as the nightly-`cargo`/`rustc` `EC=0x0` crashes (§4, §8).
  2. **`scratch` (Akuma's git client, `/bin/git`) discrepancies with real git** —
     no `-C <dir>` flag; looks for lowercase `.git/head` instead of standard
     `.git/HEAD`; and relies on CWD, which is itself broken: **`cd X && cmd` runs
     `cmd` with CWD `/`** (chdir doesn't propagate through `exec` in Akuma — verified
     `sh -c 'cd /root/akuma && pwd'` prints `/`). Fixing the chdir/exec CWD
     inheritance is the prerequisite; then align scratch's `.git` layout + add `-C`
     so it can stand in for real git in-VM. Workaround for now: pull on the host and
     re-populate the disk, or apply changes to the on-disk tree directly.

### 7a. rustc compile time: it's ext2 read + library loading, not fork+exec or CPU

Measured on the **apk** toolchain (`/usr/bin/rustc` 1.96 stable; the nightly at
`/usr/local/bin` *segfaults* on a real compile — apk is the working one), 6 GB VM,
`hello.rs`, HVF (near-native CPU). Ablation of one full compile:

| phase | eager mmap | lazy mmap | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| rustc startup (`--version`) | 11.7s | **1.7s** | load+relocate `librustc_driver`+`libLLVM` |
| read libstd metadata | 7.8s | 1.8s | ext2 read of rlibs |
| codegen | 0.1s | 0.6s | **CPU is negligible** |
| link (gcc→ld) | 16.1s | 15.6s | spawn + read rlibs + write output |
| **full** | **35.6s** | **19.6s** | lazy output verified correct |

Findings:
- **Codegen (actual compile CPU) is ~0.1s — irrelevant.** rustc is slow here
  purely from moving bytes off ext2.
- **No effective cache (by default).** Repeated identical compiles take the *same*
  time (`--version`: 11.56 / 11.74 / 11.77s). The default ext2 "cache" is a 64-slot
  ring (`BLOCK_CACHE_ENTRIES`, ~64–256 KB) — far smaller than a build's working
  set — and file-backed mmap pages aren't cached by inode. Every spawn re-reads the
  whole toolchain from disk. The opt-in **`fs-cache`** feature replaces the ring
  with a RAM-sized clock cache that fixes this — see §7c (warm re-reads become 0
  disk reads; on HVF the wall-clock win is small because the disk isn't the
  bottleneck there).
- **Eager file-backed mmap was the big tax.** `libLLVM.so` (176 MB) +
  `librustc_driver.so` (63 MB) were read *in full* at `mmap()` time even though
  rustc touches only a fraction. Flipping `release` to lazy demand-paging (1 MB
  readahead) cut startup **6.9×** and the full compile **1.8×**. Raw sequential
  ext2 read is fine (~100 MB/s via `md5sum`); the eager-mmap *load path* was the
  problem, exactly as predicted.
- **Link dominates the lazy compile (~80%, 15.6s) — and it's libstd.**
  `hello.rs` is a *std* program (`println!`), so the link statically pulls in
  libstd. A `#![no_std]` binary links in ~5s vs ~15s (≈3× cheaper) — so for the
  actual akuma kernel (which *is* `#![no_std]`) per-crate link is cheap; the std
  link cost is an artifact of the hello-world test, not the real workload.
  - `-C prefer-dynamic` (link libstd as `.so`) did **not** cut compile time
    (~19.5s ≈ static), so the residual link cost is the gcc→collect2→ld toolchain
    load + C-runtime reads, not the libstd archive read specifically.
- **Alternative linkers make it WORSE on Akuma — do not use them.** A/B on the
  std hello (default = gcc + GNU ld @ 19.3s):
  - gcc + **lld** (`-fuse-ld=lld`): **>320 s (timeout)**
  - clang + **lld**: **240 s**, and the output ELF won't even load ("Invalid ELF")
  GNU ld (binutils) wins by 12–16×. lld is a large binary and its load/relocation
  pattern thrashes the cacheless ext2. clang-as-linker-driver is also broken here.

> trust large effect sizes (lazy 1.8×, lld 12–16× worse). For fine-grained

### 7b. How long to compile the whole kernel at current speed?

`cargo build --release -j1` for akuma is **127 packages** (`Cargo.lock`) → one
`rustc` per crate + build scripts + host proc-macros + one final link. The
killer is **no cache**: the ~1.7 s lazy `rustc` startup is paid afresh for *every*
crate (≈127 × 1.7 s ≈ **3.6 min just re-paging rustc's own `.so`s**), and each
crate re-reads its upstream rlibs from ext2. Adding per-crate codegen (most are
small no_std libs ~4–8 s; a few big ones — smoltcp, embedded-tls, the kernel crate
itself — run tens of seconds to minutes), a clean `-j1` build lands at a rough
**~30–60 minutes** (wide error bars; the kernel crate + the handful of large deps
dominate). This is why the **ext2 / page cache is the right next lever**: most of
that time is re-reading the *same* read-only toolchain and rlibs off disk N times.
The **`fs-cache`** feature (§7c) is the first cut at this lever.

Things to check later:
- **`release` lazy default — DONE/SHIPPED.** `MMAP_FILE_BACKED_LAZY = true` on all
  profiles now. Eager only wins when *all* mapped pages are touched (e.g. model
  weights), not for big partially-used libs.
- **Was `extreme` ever eager?** *No — resolved.* `build.rs` makes `extreme` imply
  `kernel_profile_size` (extreme ⇒ `OPT_LEVEL=z` ⇒ `size_profile` ⇒
  `kernel_profile_size` cfg), so the old `#[cfg(not(kernel_profile_size))]` already
  excluded it. `size` and `extreme` have used lazy all along; only `release` was
  eager. The gating is now written explicitly as `any(size, extreme)`.

### 7c. The `fs-cache` feature: a large clock block cache — SHIPPED (opt-in)

The 64-slot block ring (`BLOCK_CACHE_ENTRIES`, ~256 KB) is far smaller than a
build's working set, so it gives no reuse: every spawn re-streams the toolchain
off virtio-blk. The **`fs-cache`** cargo feature replaces it with a much larger,
clock-eviction block cache that keeps the read-only toolchain resident across the
many rustc/cc/ld spawns.

- **Build it in:** `cargo build --release --features fs-cache`. Off by default; not
  added to any default set and **never combined with `extreme`** (the 4 MB profile
  keeps its no-cache path). Plumbing mirrors `extreme`: kernel feature
  `fs-cache` → `akuma-ext2/fs-cache` → `build.rs` emits `cfg(ext2_fs_cache)`.
- **Sizing:** RAM-derived, set in `src/fs.rs::init()` before mount via
  `akuma_ext2::set_cache_cap_bytes(min(25% RAM, 512 MB))`. On a 6–16 GB self-host
  VM that's the full 512 MB — enough to hold the hot toolchain set.
- **Policy:** CLOCK / second-chance (one reference bit per slot via `Cell`, a
  rotating hand), so frequently-touched toolchain blocks survive while cold blocks
  stream past — a pure ring would evict the hot set as the working set overflows.
  Lookup is O(log n) via a `block_num → slot` `BTreeMap` (a linear scan over the
  ~131 072 slots of a 512 MB cache per block read would dwarf the disk read it
  avoids). Write-through with per-block invalidation is preserved.
- **Scope:** physical-block keyed; `read_block`, `read_at_by_inode` (the file-backed
  mmap fault path, previously cache-bypassing), **and metadata** — `read_inode`,
  `read_bgd`, `write_inode`, `write_bgd` — all consult and populate it. The metadata
  functions used to issue direct sub-block `dev.read_bytes` for each inode/descriptor;
  under the feature they read the *containing* block through the cache (`read_range_cached`),
  and writes go read-modify-write through `write_block` so a cached inode/BGD block
  can't go stale (the only correctness coupling — it's why metadata caching is part of
  `fs-cache`, not a separate switch). Reading the 4 KB block is also a *prefetch*: it
  pulls ~16 neighbouring inodes that a directory scan stats next. *Not* routed through
  the cache: the inode/block bitmaps already go via `read_block`; the superblock is
  read once at mount and never via `read_block`, so it stays direct.
- **Tests:** clock/second-chance/dedup/remove/floor unit tests in
  `crates/akuma-ext2/src/tests.rs`; the full fs read/write suite run under
  `--features fs-cache` exercises the cached inode/BGD RMW path (proves write
  invalidation). A boot self-test (`test_fs_cache_warm_reread_hits` in
  `src/process_tests.rs`, gated on `feature = "fs-cache"`) reads a temp file twice
  (data: `warm misses=0`) **and** re-resolves a path twice (metadata: `hit>0, miss=0`).

**Two workloads, two very different stories (`scripts/ext2_cache_bench.sh` and
`ext2_cache_meta_bench.sh`, MEMORY=6144M, HVF, `disk_selfhost.img`):**

*File data — mmap 320 MB `librustc_driver.so`, touch every page:*

| kernel | cold | warm | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| no cache (64-slot ring) | 4.47s | 4.48s | warm/cold = 1.00× (floor) |
| `--features fs-cache`   | 6.38s | 4.32s | warm fully cached (`warm misses=0`) |

Marginal on HVF — only ~6% on warm, and cold *regresses* ~+1.9s. Under HVF the
"disk" is a host file already in the Mac's page cache, so this demand-paged mmap is
**page-fault-bound, not disk-bound**; the extra copy into the cache is then mostly
overhead. (It's the IOP/latency win below that matters, not file-data bandwidth.)

*Metadata — `du -s /usr/local/lib/rustlib` (493 MB, thousands of files; pure stat
walk):*

| kernel / variant | cold | warm | speedup |
|---|---|---|---|
| no cache | 6.55s | 6.51s | 1.00× (floor) |
| `fs-cache`, **data blocks only** (inode/BGD bypass) | 6.79s | 6.76s | **1.00× — none** |
| `fs-cache`, **full** (inode/BGD cached) | 0.39s | 0.34s | **~19×** |

**This is the real result.** A metadata-heavy walk — exactly what a `cargo build`
*is* (open/stat hundreds of rlibs and re-walk the same prefix dirs across 127
spawns) — goes **~19× faster, even cold**, and the isolation row proves it's *all*
from the inode/BGD caching: caching directory *data* blocks alone does nothing,
because the dominant cost was thousands of tiny separate `dev.read_bytes` IOPs for
inodes/descriptors. The cache collapses them into a handful of 4 KB block reads
(each prefetching 16 inodes) plus cache hits. And this is *under HVF* — the win is
**IOP/latency**, not bandwidth, so it survives even when the host page-caches the
disk. Expect it to be larger still on TCG / real storage.

Takeaway: `fs-cache`'s payoff is **metadata / IOP reduction**, not file-data
bandwidth. Shipped opt-in (it's not in any default set and never combines with
`extreme`); on by intent for the self-host / cluster build path.

Still open / follow-ups:
- **Memory-pressure shrink.** The cache is bounded by the RAM-derived cap but does
  not yet shrink under `is_memory_low`. Wire a reclaim hook so a cache that grew to
  512 MB can be dropped if user demand-paging needs the pages.
- **Cold-path tax (file data).** The per-block `BTreeMap` insert + extra backing copy
  cost ~+40% on the first *bulk* read (the metadata path has no such regression —
  it's faster even cold). An open-addressing index would trim it.
- **Measure a full `cargo build -j1`** with the cache on, now that the metadata path
  — the build's real bottleneck — is cached.

### 7d. Compiling a userspace crate (libakuma `hello`) in-VM — IN PROGRESS

A much smaller self-host target than the kernel: compile a `userspace/` crate that
links `libakuma` directly in the VM (`hello` first, then `httpd`). Findings
(June 2026, fs-cache kernel, `disk_selfhost.img`, 8 GB):

- **Toolchain combo:** the **nightly `cargo`** (`/usr/local/bin/cargo`) **crashes**
  at startup in Akuma (`[Exception] Unknown from EL0: EC=0x0`, ~31 syscalls in) — the
  same "nightly segfaults" seen for a real `rustc` compile. The **apk `cargo` 1.96**
  (`/usr/bin/cargo`) runs fine, but apk's rust only ships the `aarch64-alpine-linux-musl`
  target. So the working combo is **apk cargo + `RUSTC=/usr/local/bin/rustc`** (nightly
  rustc has the `aarch64-unknown-none` std the userspace target needs):
  `busybox env PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin HOME=/root CARGO_HOME=/root/.cargo RUSTC=/usr/local/bin/rustc cargo build --release -p hello --manifest-path /root/akuma/userspace/Cargo.toml`
- **Workspace must be loadable.** Cargo requires *every* listed workspace member's
  `Cargo.toml` to be present just to *load* the workspace — so a missing submodule
  (e.g. `meow`) blocks building even unrelated crates like `hello`. Fixed by
  temporarily removing the submodule-backed members (`meow`, `tcc`, `llama.cpp`,
  `crush`, `nca`) from `userspace/Cargo.toml`'s `members`, removing the stale `xbps`
  submodule from `.gitmodules`, and repointing `meow`/`crush` from `git@github` to
  `https` (so the in-VM checkout needs no SSH key).
- **cargo-over-TLS works (the key result).** `cargo build -p hello` downloaded all
  deps from crates.io over the VM's network (HTTPS) into `/root/.cargo/registry` and
  began compiling them — no vendoring needed (updates §1.3).
- **The build-script wall.** The build then parks on `embedded-io-async`'s `build.rs`
  (a build script cargo compiles *and executes* on the build machine; it probes the
  compiler by spawning `rustc`). Fork+exec-of-rustc-from-a-build-script is the sticky
  point for in-VM builds. **Fixed by feature-gating** `embedded-io-async` in
  `libakuma` behind a `net-async` feature that is **off by default** (it only gates
  the `embedded_io_async::Error` impl in `net.rs`). Consumers that use the async IO
  traits opt in with `features = ["net-async"]` — currently just **`sshd`**
  (`embedded_io_async::{Read,Write}` + libakuma); `hello` and `httpd` use neither, so
  they get a minimal tree with no flags. A fresh `hello` build is then just **6
  crates, none with a rustc-probing build.rs**: `format_no_std`, `scopeguard`,
  `lock_api`, `talc`, `libakuma`, `hello`. (`embedded-io-async` may be dropped from
  `libakuma` entirely later if `sshd` can use its own copy.)
- **Runtime verified.** The shipped `/bin/hello` (libakuma-linked) runs correctly in
  the VM (`hello (1/10)`…`(10/10)`, `uptime≈expected`), confirming the libakuma
  runtime/ABI on Akuma — independent of the in-VM compile.
- **The next wall: `rustc` futex deadlock — ROOT-CAUSED & FIXED.** With the
  build-script crate gone, the build *does* reach codegen — and then **`rustc`
  hung on a futex**. Observed building `scopeguard` (the first dep): kernel PSTATS
  frozen across three 60 s samples — `rustc` PID stuck at `1448 syscalls`,
  `futex=78 (440716ms)`, `in_kernel ≈ 441 s`, zero forward progress; `cargo`
  parked waiting on it. It had paged in ~200 MB (the toolchain) and deadlocked
  *mid-compile*, not at startup. **Not OOM** (6.3 GB free of 8 GB).
  **Nondeterministic** and **got worse the deeper into the build it ran.**

  - **Root cause — `FUTEX_WAIT_BITSET` absolute timeout treated as relative**
    (NOT a lost-wakeup; the wait/wake core is sound — its sticky `WOKEN_STATES`
    flag, re-checked after `mark_thread_waiting`, closes the wait-entry window).
    Rust std emits an **absolute** `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` deadline (`now + dur`) via
    `FUTEX_WAIT_BITSET` **without** the `CLOCK_REALTIME` flag for *every* timed
    wait (`Condvar::wait_timeout`, `park_timeout`, `Mutex`/`Once` contention —
    exactly rustc's rayon/jobserver idle loops). Akuma's `sys_futex` only treated
    `FUTEX_WAIT_BITSET` timeouts as absolute when the realtime flag was set; the
    monotonic case fell through to the relative branch and added `uptime_us()` to
    an already-absolute, `uptime`-based deadline. Effective wait ≈ `2·uptime + dur`
    — and since it scales with current uptime, a short timed wait silently became
    an ~800 s one after the toolchain had paged in for ~400 s, presenting as a
    nondeterministic, deeper-is-worse "deadlock."
  - **Fix** (`src/syscall/sync.rs`): `FUTEX_WAIT_BITSET` deadlines are now
    absolute (Linux semantics) for **both** clocks. Monotonic == `uptime_us`, used
    directly; realtime is converted into uptime terms via `utc_time_us()`. Plain
    `FUTEX_WAIT` stays relative.
  - **Regression test** (`src/sync_tests.rs`):
    `test_futex_wait_bitset_monotonic_absolute_deadline` parks on an absolute
    monotonic deadline `uptime_now + 100 ms` and asserts the wait ends *near that
    deadline*, not ~uptime later. Verified to **fail on the old code** (panic:
    `overshoot 1,131,264 us` ≈ the uptime at call) and **pass after the fix**
    (overshoot ~7.5 ms). All 30 boot-suite futex tests pass.

- **The wall after that: the linker output was 0 bytes — `MAP_SHARED` writeback
  (IMPLEMENTED).** With the futex fix the build now compiles all 6 crates
  (`scopeguard`, `lock_api`, `talc`, `libakuma`, `format_no_std`, `hello`) and
  reaches the **link step** — further than the futex deadlock ever allowed. `cargo`
  reports `Finished`, but the linked `hello` landed on disk as **0 bytes**.
  - **Root cause.** `rust-lld` (the default linker for `aarch64-unknown-none`)
    writes its output through a writable `MAP_SHARED` file-backed `mmap`
    (LLVM `FileOutputBuffer`), then `munmap`s + `renameat`s it into place. Akuma
    had **no unified page cache**, so it silently downgraded writable `MAP_SHARED`
    file mappings to `MAP_PRIVATE` (`src/syscall/mem.rs`) — lld's writes went to
    private anonymous frames that were never flushed back, so the file stayed
    empty.
  - **Fix.** Implemented writable `MAP_SHARED` file-backed mappings with explicit
    writeback (`src/syscall/mem.rs`): such a mapping is now allocated **eagerly**
    (all pages resident, populated from the file, mapped RW) and tracked in
    `SHARED_FILE_MAPPINGS` by `(tgid, base_va)`. Its resident pages are copied back
    to the backing file on **`munmap`**, **`msync`** (was a no-op stub; now wired —
    the POSIX flush point lld uses), and **process exit** (`sys_exit`/
    `sys_exit_group`, so a process that drops the mapping by exiting still
    persists, and stale `(tgid, base)` entries can't mis-fire after tgid reuse).
    Read-only `MAP_SHARED` is unchanged (no writes → stays on the cheap lazy path).
    Eager-only: a writable `MAP_SHARED` that can't get its frames returns `ENOMEM`
    rather than silently dropping writes (so huge outputs under memory pressure are
    the known limit; fine for userspace self-host binaries).
  - **Test.** Boot self-test `test_shared_file_mmap_writeback`
    (`src/process_tests.rs`): fills two resident pages with a pattern, calls the
    writeback path, and verifies the file (incl. a partial last page) — `PASSED
    (wrote 4196 bytes, pattern verified)`.
  - **END-TO-END VERIFIED.** In-VM, `hello` now compiles (apk `cargo` +
    `RUSTC=`nightly, `--target aarch64-unknown-none`), links to a **4128-byte**
    binary (kernel log: `[mmap] … (shared-writable, writeback on)` →
    `[munmap] … shared-writeback … 4128 bytes`), and **runs correctly**:
    `hello (1/10)`…`(10/10)`, `done`, `uptime=9007ms expected=9000ms overhead=+7ms`.
    This is the first full in-VM self-host compile **and run** of a userspace crate.
  - **`httpd` too (VERIFIED, decisively).** The same flow compiles `httpd` in-VM
    (~30 s, writeback flushed a ~42 KB binary) and it **serves**. `httpd` was made
    to read its listen port from the `HTTP_PORT` env var (then argv[1], then the
    8080 default) so the freshly-built binary can run **alongside** the autostarted
    `/bin/httpd` (still on 8080) on a *different* port — proving the server that
    answers is unambiguously the new build, since the old binary hardcodes 8080 and
    has no env-port code. Running the rebuilt binary with `HTTP_PORT=4444`, it binds
    4444 and serves: in-VM `busybox wget http://127.0.0.1:4444/` → `index.html`
    (20595 B, exact match), `GET /nope.txt` → `404`, and host `curl localhost:4444`
    (forwarded) → `200`/20595 B — while `/bin/httpd` keeps serving 8080 independently.
    (Disk note: SSH-stdin file copy truncated the source; re-stage the file
    host-side via the Docker loop-mount, or `git`-pull on the disk, then rebuild.)
  - **In-VM build invocation (works today).** CWD is `/` over `ssh host cmd`
    (§7 chdir bug), so cargo can't find `userspace/.cargo/config.toml`; pass the
    target + rustflags via env instead, and call **apk** cargo explicitly (nightly
    cargo crashes at startup, §7d):
    `busybox env PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin HOME=/root CARGO_HOME=/root/.cargo RUSTC=/usr/local/bin/rustc CARGO_BUILD_TARGET=aarch64-unknown-none CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_UNKNOWN_NONE_RUSTFLAGS=-Crelocation-model=static /usr/bin/cargo build --release -p hello --manifest-path /root/akuma/userspace/Cargo.toml`
    (note: cargo's incremental cache treats a previously-linked 0-byte `hello` as
    fresh; `rm -rf target/aarch64-unknown-none` to force the relink that exercises
    writeback).

**Disk refresh (how to get repo changes in-VM):** in-VM `git` can't pull (§7,
git-remote-https SIGSEGV; scratch broken), so re-stage `/root/akuma` host-side via
Docker — privileged Alpine, `mount -o loop disk_selfhost.img`, `git clone --depth 1
--branch <branch> https://github.com/netoneko/akuma.git /mnt/disk/root/akuma`,
`umount`. (`netoneko/akuma` is public; no token needed. No submodule init required —
the workspace `members` no longer reference them.)

**Next session:** the in-VM self-host compile **and run** now works end-to-end for
both **`hello`** and **`httpd`** (futex fix + `MAP_SHARED` writeback above). Next:
push toward larger crates / the kernel itself. Watch for: (a) the
eager-only writable-`MAP_SHARED` limit on large link outputs under memory pressure;
(b) the §7 chdir/CWD bug still forces the env-var build invocation; (c) the
intermittent `EC=0x0` exec corruption (§8) seen once when an SSH command violated
the mini-shell grammar. Committed: the futex fix + regression test (`f7ea7dc`),
plus the earlier workspace/gate work (faedd3a/6ba831a). Uncommitted: the
`MAP_SHARED` writeback (`src/syscall/mem.rs`, `mod.rs`, `proc.rs`) + its self-test
(`src/process_tests.rs`), these doc updates + `scripts/ext2_cache_*bench.sh`.

### 7e. First in-VM **kernel** `cargo build` attempt — reaches dep compilation, walls on `proc-macro2`'s build script (June 18 2026)

First attempt at building the **akuma kernel itself** inside the VM (the §7d work
proved userspace crates; this is the kernel). Kernel boot: `--release
--features fs-cache`; VM `MEMORY=12288M`, `disk_selfhost.img`, HVF.

**Setup that got it building.** The kernel can't be driven by the nightly `cargo`
(it still crashes at startup — see below), so the only working driver is the §7d
combo **apk `cargo` 1.96 + `RUSTC=`nightly**. apk cargo is *stable*, so it refuses
the workspace's nightly-only bits at manifest-parse time. Two edits to the on-disk
`/root/akuma/Cargo.toml` make it stable-parseable for a **release** build (release
is `panic="abort"`, so neither bit is actually needed by it):

1. delete the top line `cargo-features = ["panic-immediate-abort"]`;
2. change `profile.size`'s `panic = "immediate-abort"` → `panic = "abort"`.

Edit the image host-side via the Docker loop-mount (the §7d disk-refresh
mechanism); a backup is left at `Cargo.toml.selfhost-bak`. Then build with the
env-var invocation (CWD-is-`/` over ssh, §7, means `.cargo/config.toml` is not
read — pass target + the linker-script rustflag explicitly):

```
/bin/busybox env PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin HOME=/root CARGO_HOME=/root/.cargo \
  RUSTC=/usr/local/bin/rustc CARGO_BUILD_TARGET=aarch64-unknown-none \
  CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_UNKNOWN_NONE_RUSTFLAGS=-Clink-arg=-T/root/akuma/linker.ld \
  /usr/bin/cargo build --release -p akuma --manifest-path /root/akuma/Cargo.toml -j1
```

**What worked (further than ever):**
- **apk cargo parses the kernel workspace** after the 2-line edit.
- **cargo's own git-over-HTTPS fetch works in-VM** — it cloned the `embedded-tls`
  GitHub fork (1437/1551 deltas, full checkout) and updated the crates.io index.
  Notable because §7's `git-remote-https` *binary* SIGSEGVs; cargo uses its own
  client (libgit2/gitoxide), which is fine. So git deps are **not** a blocker.
- **~11 leaf deps compile cleanly** (zeroize, typenum, version_check,
  generic-array, crypto-common, subtle, const-oid + their build scripts), driven
  by apk-cargo-orchestrates + nightly-`rustc`-per-crate, host target
  `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`. Reached **step 12/147**.

**The wall — `proc-macro2`'s compiler-probing build script deadlocks.** This is
the §7d "build.rs that probes the compiler by spawning rustc **parks**" wall, now
pinned to a crate that is **unavoidable for the kernel** (every derive macro —
`zerocopy`, `thiserror`, `serde`-likes, etc. — depends on `proc-macro2`). The §7d
workaround (delete the offending crate) is not an option here.

Sequence from the kernel log: `[T200.20]` proc-macro2's `build-script-build` runs
→ `[T200.82]` it execs a child `rustc --cfg=procmacro2_build_probe` → `[T201.75]`
that probe rustc **exits cleanly** (teardown munmaps) → then **silence**; the build
sits at `12/147: proc-macro2(build)` indefinitely with the **CPU fully idle**
(heartbeat idle-loop spinning at 38M) — a hard **deadlock**, not slowness.

Diagnosis via the in-VM `ps` builtin + PSTATS:
- **cargo's main thread is blocked in `futex` (syscall 98)** — its coordinator
  waiting on a worker that never reports completion.
- **Two `rustc --cfg=procmacro2_build_probe` processes (pids 231, 233) are still
  alive but orphaned** — their parents (230, 232) have exited. They are parked in
  a **non-syscall kernel wait** (`ps` SYSCALL column `-`, i.e. `current_syscall ==
  !0`, not futex, not any syscall) while the CPU is idle. A userspace thread can
  only block via a syscall or a page fault, so this points at a **page-fault
  (demand-paging) wait** or a scheduler-level park that never gets woken —
  resolvable only with a live debugger.
- The pipe machinery is **not** the cause: per-spawn build-script pipes close
  cleanly (`[pipe] DESTROY`), and fork/exit pipe refcounting is symmetric
  (`clone_deep_for_fork` bumps; `close_all` on exit decrements — `fd.rs`). The
  jobserver pipe (id 63) shows an elevated `write_count` (~12, inherited by every
  forked child) but it drains, so it's a suspect to confirm, not the proven cause.

**Still-confirmed blocker:** nightly **`cargo`** still dies at startup with
`[Exception] Unknown from EL0: EC=0x0` (~31 syscalls in, after paging ~11 MB) —
unchanged by the futex/`MAP_SHARED` fixes. nightly **`rustc`** runs fine; only
nightly cargo crashes. This is why apk cargo is the driver.

**Next session — root-cause the build-script→rustc-probe deadlock.** It is THE
blocker for kernel self-host (any proc-macro pulls in `proc-macro2`). Plan:
build a *deterministic minimal repro* (a tiny crate whose `build.rs` just
`Command::new("rustc").arg("--version").output()`s, or replays proc-macro2's
probe), boot with `GDB=1`, and attach lldb (`docs/` lldb+gdbstub note) to a stuck
orphaned `rustc` probe to read its actual kernel wait state (page-fault vs.
futex/park) — that one fact picks the fix. Suspects to check statically
meanwhile: the demand-paging fault wait/wakeup path, and orphan reparenting
(`ps` shows orphans keeping a dead PPID — Akuma does not reparent to init).

### 7f. Minimal repro built — the wall is NOT "build.rs spawns rustc" (June 18 2026, IN PROGRESS)

Built the deterministic minimal repro the §7e plan called for, and it **narrowed
the cause significantly**. Repro crate is in the host tree at `userspace/selfhost_repro/`
(excluded from the userspace workspace — built only inside the VM)
(`Cargo.toml`, `lib.rs`, `build.rs`) and staged on `disk_selfhost.img` at
`/root/repro` via the Docker loop-mount.

**Build/run invocation (in-VM, over ssh on :2322 with `INSTANCE=1`):**
```
env PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin HOME=/root CARGO_HOME=/root/.cargo \
  RUSTC=/usr/local/bin/rustc \
  /usr/bin/cargo build -vv --manifest-path /root/repro/Cargo.toml
```
Note: the in-kernel SSH mini-shell does **not** support `2>&1`/fd redirection
(it creates a literal file named `&1`); run the command bare and let the host
capture both streams (e.g. Python `subprocess` `capture_output`). No `busybox
sh -c` wrapper needed.

**Result of the first repro (DID NOT deadlock).** A build.rs that does the
"obvious" probes — `rustc --version`, `rustc -vV`, and a stdin-piped
`rustc --emit=metadata -` compiling a snippet, **all for the host target** —
**completes cleanly** (`child exited ok=true`, build `Finished` in ~28 s). So the
wall is **not** the generic "a forked build script spawns a child rustc and waits"
shape. That shape works on Akuma.

**What's actually different about proc-macro2's probe** (read from the vendored
`selfhost_vendor/proc-macro2/build.rs` → `do_compile_probe`), any of which could
be the trigger:
- **`--target $TARGET`** where, for the kernel build, `TARGET=aarch64-unknown-none`
  (the bare-metal kernel target, **not** the host). The probe rustc therefore
  loads that target's sysroot (libcore etc.) — a **different file-backed mmap /
  demand-paging path** than the host-libstd path the first repro exercised. This
  is the prime suspect (the kernel build sets `CARGO_BUILD_TARGET=aarch64-unknown-none`,
  so build-script `TARGET` is the bare-metal triple).
- It appends **`CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTFLAGS`** (the `-Clink-arg=-T/root/akuma/linker.ld`
  rustflag from the env-var invocation) to the probe command.
- `--emit=dep-info,metadata` (writes a `.d` file too), `--cfg=procmacro2_build_probe`,
  `--cap-lints=allow`, compiling a real file containing `extern crate proc_macro;`.
- It `fs::create_dir`s an OUT_DIR/probe subdir and `fs::remove_dir_all`s it after.
- It runs the probe **up to twice** (with/without `RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP`) — matching
  the "two orphaned rustc probes" observation in §7e.

**Next step (repro v2, staged but NOT yet run).** `userspace/selfhost_repro/build.rs` was
rewritten to faithfully replay `do_compile_probe` — `--target aarch64-unknown-none`,
the linker rustflag via `CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTFLAGS`, `--emit=dep-info,metadata`,
`extern crate proc_macro`, the create_dir/remove_dir_all, run twice — with a
`[REPRO] …` marker before/after **each** step (write probe src, create_dir, spawn,
return-from-wait, remove_dir_all) so the kernel console pins the exact walling
step. Run it with `CARGO_BUILD_TARGET=aarch64-unknown-none` and the linker rustflag
so the build-script `TARGET` is the bare-metal triple:
```
env PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin HOME=/root CARGO_HOME=/root/.cargo \
  RUSTC=/usr/local/bin/rustc CARGO_BUILD_TARGET=aarch64-unknown-none \
  CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_UNKNOWN_NONE_RUSTFLAGS=-Clink-arg=-T/root/akuma/linker.ld \
  /usr/bin/cargo build -vv --manifest-path /root/repro/Cargo.toml
```
(`REPRO_PROBES=N` controls how many times it loops the probe; `REPRO_MODE` from
the first version is gone.) If v2 reproduces, boot `INSTANCE=1 GDB=1` and attach
lldb (gdbstub :1235, ssh :2322) to the stuck rustc to read its kernel wait state
(page-fault wait vs futex/park) per the §7e plan. If it still does **not** wall,
the trigger is the **accumulated** state after ~11 prior crate compiles (a per-
spawn leak — child-channel registry / fault-set / pid), and the next repro is a
loop of N back-to-back rustc spawns, or a crate that path-depends on the vendored
`proc-macro2` directly (also in `selfhost_vendor/`).

Working notes/commands for resuming: kernel built (`cargo build --release`); boot
`MEMORY=6144 DISK=disk_selfhost.img INSTANCE=1 GDB=1 cargo run --release`; wait for
`SSH Server] Listening` then drive the build over ssh :2322 from Python.

### 7g. Repro v2 REPRODUCES the hang — root cause is a parked-thread missed wakeup, NOT the fault path (June 19 2026)

Repro v2 (`do_compile_probe` with `--target aarch64-unknown-none`) **deterministically
reproduces the hang within ~seconds** (no need to compile 11 deps first). It is the
real proc-macro2 wall.

**Findings (live, via in-VM `ps` + a serial `[THR-DUMP]` heartbeat dump):**

- **The hang is a PARK, not a spin.** lldb PC-sampling (60 samples) caught only
  background threads (`smoltcp_net::poll`, `ssh::server::run`, the SGI reschedule
  path) — never a cargo/rustc thread. The CPU genuinely idles. So the stuck user
  threads are blocked (`schedule_blocking`/WAITING), not busy-spinning.
- **Process tree when hung:** cargo main (`pid 95`) parked in `futex` (sc=98);
  build-script in `wait4`; the probe `rustc` chain (`pid 182 → 184 → 185 …`) and a
  cargo worker parked **not in any syscall** (`sc = -`).
- **`[THR-DUMP]` (saved kernel/user resume points) is the smoking gun:** **six**
  threads — cargo worker `pid 108`/`180` and the rustc probes `183/185/187/189` —
  are all in **WAITING** state parked at the **identical user PC `elr=0x30060cc4`**
  with `current_syscall = !0` (not inside a syscall). cargo main is separately
  parked in `futex` (sc=98). Six independent processes blocked at the *same* user
  instruction = a shared wait/park primitive (a futex/`sched_yield`/park call site
  in the rustc/musl binary) whose **wake is never delivered**.
- rustc first demand-pages its ~**221 MB** `librustc_driver` (`filesz=0xd38c000`)
  via ~1700 scattered instruction faults (normal, makes progress) and *then* parks.
  So the hang is downstream of paging, in the wait/wake handoff.

**This is (most likely) a futex / thread-park missed-wakeup**, exactly the
"sc=98 classic hang" class. The earlier `fault_mutex` poison fix (§ below) is a
real latent-deadlock fix but is **NOT** this bug (its `[FAULT-RECLAIM]` never fired
here).

**Fix committed regardless — `fault_mutex` poison recovery.** The per-page
demand-paging serialization (`Process.fault_mutex`) was a `BTreeSet<page_va>` with
no owner tracking: a thread that died mid-fault (RAII release guard never runs on
kernel thread teardown) left the slot poisoned, so siblings faulting that page spun
in `yield_now` forever. Now `BTreeMap<page_va, holder_tid>` with
`fault_slot_acquire`/`fault_slot_release` (crates/akuma-exec/src/process/children.rs):
a spinner reclaims the slot if the holder is `is_thread_terminated`, with a bounded
fallback for a wedged/recycled holder. Wired into all 3 fault sites in
`exceptions.rs` (CoW/DA/IA) + a `[FAULT-RECLAIM]` log. Regression self-test:
`test_fault_mutex_insert_remove` in `src/process_tests.rs`.

**Debugging aids added (keep until the futex bug is fixed):**
- `ps` builtin prints each process's saved kernel resume point (`x30`/`elr`).
- Heartbeat dumps `[THR-DUMP]` (per-thread state + pid + `current_syscall` +
  `x30`/`elr`/`sp`) every ~8 heartbeats when `waiting >= 2` —
  `threading::dump_thread_resume_points()`. Survives the SSH wedge (serial only).

**Next:** build a **userspace futex test suite** (multi-thread WAIT/WAKE,
WAIT_BITSET, requeue, wake-before-wait races, PI, timeouts) run as boot self-tests +
a standalone userspace binary, to pin the missed-wakeup. Suspect areas: the
futex hash-bucket match between waker and waiter, wake-before-wait (sticky wake),
and `schedule_blocking` wake delivery when `current_syscall` has been cleared.
Resolve user PC `0x30060cc4` against the in-VM rustc/musl binary to confirm it's the
futex wait call site.

#### 7g.1 — Refinement after futex tracing + binary analysis (June 19 2026, STILL OPEN)

Ran the reliable repro with `FUTEX_DBG_ENABLED=true` + a per-exit `[cct-exit]` log
+ a serial `[THR-DUMP]`. New facts:

- **cargo main is NOT stuck on a lost wake — it POLLS.** Its futex wait on
  `0x1e0e89fb0` is a *timed* wait that returns `ETIMEDOUT` every ~520 ms and
  re-waits forever. It's waiting for a child build unit that never reports done.
- **`clear_child_tid` / `pthread_join` wakes WORK.** Every `[cct-exit]` showed
  `mapped=true` and fired its `futex_wake`; whole rustc thread-groups (e.g. tgid
  110, pids 158–176 + leader 115) exited cleanly. So the earlier "gated futex_wake"
  hypothesis was **wrong** for the common case. (The fix — always `futex_wake`,
  gate only the user-memory write — was kept anyway: it's correct in principle and
  cheap. `src/syscall/proc.rs`, `crates/akuma-exec/src/process/mod.rs`.)
- **The truly-stuck threads park at a libc/ld-musl PC, not in futex.** `ps` +
  `[THR-DUMP]`: six processes — cargo's build-unit children (108, 180) and the
  **orphaned** rustc probes (183/185/187/189, parents 182/184/186/188 already
  exited) — are all in **WAITING** at the identical user PC `elr=0x30060cc4`,
  `current_syscall = !0`, and `last_syscall = 0` (per `ps` `-`). i.e. blocked in a
  syscall **without** `current_syscall` set, having (apparently) never completed
  one.
- **`/usr/local/bin/rustc` is a 72 KB dynamically-linked PIE** (interp
  `/lib/ld-musl-aarch64.so.1`, needs `librustc_driver-*.so` (~221 MB, the
  `filesz=0xd38c000` segment at `0x30100000`) + `libc.so`). `0x30060cc4` sits
  *below* the 221 MB lib → it's in **libc/ld-musl** — a musl syscall-return site
  shared across these statically-laid-out objects, which is why every stuck
  process shows the *same* PC.
- **Ruled out:** syscall `78` = `readlinkat` returning `EINVAL` in a loop at libc
  PC `0x30069828` is **expected** (the path isn't a symlink) — a startup red
  herring, not the hang.
- **Also confirmed:** the `fault_mutex` poison fix never engaged here
  (`[FAULT-RECLAIM]` never printed) — it's a real but *separate* latent bug.

**Working theory (unconfirmed):** the stuck processes are **forked/cloned children
of multithreaded rustc** parked at a libc syscall site and never woken — either a
classic fork-in-a-multithreaded-program lock inheritance (child waits on a libc
lock/futex whose owning thread doesn't exist in the child) or a `CLONE_VFORK`/
`posix_spawn` handshake the kernel mishandles. The repeated orphaning (parents
exited, children alive at the same PC) and Akuma's lack of orphan→init reparenting
(§7e) are consistent with this.

**Decisive next experiments:**
1. Resolve `0x30060cc4` to a musl symbol: extract `/lib/ld-musl-aarch64.so.1` from
   the disk (Docker loop-mount), find its load base from the boot mmap trace, and
   `llvm-objdump` the function — names the exact wait primitive (lock vs futex vs
   nanosleep vs clone-return).
2. lldb single-step one stuck child (`INSTANCE=1 GDB=1`) to read x8 (syscall nr)
   at the `svc` just before `0x30060cc4`, and whether it ever runs.
3. Check `CLONE_VFORK`/`posix_spawn` handling in `sys_clone` and the fork child's
   READY transition for a race.

**Test asset added:** `userspace/selfhost_repro/futextest.rs` — a self-contained
multi-thread/futex stress binary (spawn+join, fan-out, mutex+condvar, barrier,
wake-before-wait, park/unpark), built in-VM via `rustc -O futextest.rs`. NOTE:
building it in-VM currently **hangs rustc itself** (same bug), so cross-build the
binary on a Linux/aarch64 musl host and stage it, rather than building in-VM.

**Debug aids (gated OFF by default; flip on to resume):** `FUTEX_DBG_ENABLED` and
`DEADLOCK_THREAD_DUMP_ENABLED` in `src/config.rs`; the `ps` builtin's saved-kernel-PC
column and `threading::dump_thread_resume_points()` / `get_saved_kernel_resume()`.

### 7h. ROOT CAUSE FOUND + FIXED — exit_group reaped siblings AFTER notifying the parent (June 19 2026)

Instrumentation drill-down (per-thread `current_syscall`, futex uaddr in `[THR-DUMP]`,
full `FUTEX_DBG` WAIT/WAKE trace, `[exit93]`/`[exit94]`/`[ktg]`/`[eg-*]` markers) pinned
the deadlock to an **ordering race in `sys_exit_group`**.

**The mechanism.** rustc's rayon worker threads (CLONE_THREAD, sharing the leader's
`tgid`/`l0_phys`) park in `FUTEX_WAIT`. When rustc finishes, its leader thread calls
`exit_group`, whose job is to reap those siblings via `kill_thread_group` (which
marks each sibling TERMINATED **and wakes it** so it leaves its futex wait and exits).
But `sys_exit_group` did this in the wrong order:

```
proc.state = Zombie;
notify_child_channel_exited(pid);   // <-- wakes the PARENT's wait4
...
kill_thread_group(pid, …);          // <-- reaps the worker siblings
```

On a single core, `notify_child_channel_exited` wakes the parent's `wait4`, which
immediately preempts the exiting thread and **reaps the leader** (`unregister_process`),
terminating the leader's `exit_group` thread **before it ever runs
`kill_thread_group`**. The rayon workers are then orphaned: never terminated, never
woken — stuck in `FUTEX_WAIT` forever. No `FUTEX_WAKE` is ever issued on their futex
words (confirmed: the entire trace shows zero wakes on `0x3d3c5ec4`/`0x3d71c658`).
The process never fully dies, so `cargo`'s `wait4`/jobserver poll blocks forever.

Trace proof: leaders **with** stuck workers logged `[exit94]` but **no `[ktg]`** (the
thread was killed between the two), while clean exits logged `[ktg … siblings=N]`.

**The fix** (`src/syscall/proc.rs`, `sys_exit_group`): reap the thread group **before**
notifying the parent — call `kill_thread_group` first, then
`notify_child_channel_exited`. Now every sibling is terminated + woken regardless of
when the parent runs. (Flush of writable `MAP_SHARED` mappings still precedes the kill,
so the address space is intact for it.)

**Validation.** After the fix, repro v2 runs to completion: `[REPRO] DONE — build.rs
completed without deadlock`, the build proceeds to compile `lib.rs`, and fails with the
**expected** `error[E0463]: can't find crate for std` (the repro's `lib.rs` needs std
but the build target is bare-metal `aarch64-unknown-none`) — i.e. no hang, normal build
progression. `[ktg] my_pid=182 siblings=3` / `my_pid=186 siblings=3` now fire (workers
reaped); the post-build process table is clean (no orphans, `wait=1`).

**Residual (still open).** A heavier multi-threaded rustc compile (building
`userspace/selfhost_repro/futextest.rs` in-VM) **still wedges** — a *distinct*
manifestation: a futex wait that hangs **during** rustc's run (workers waiting on the
main thread mid-compile), not at thread-group exit. The §7h fix does not cover it.
Next: re-run with `FUTEX_DBG`/`THR-DUMP` on and find which side fails to issue the
`FUTEX_WAKE` while the leader is still alive. The userspace futex test suite
(`futextest.rs`) is the tool to isolate it once it can be built (cross-build on a
Linux/aarch64-musl host and stage the binary, since building it in-VM trips the
residual hang).

**Separately fixed (latent, not this bug):** `fault_mutex` poison recovery
(holder-tracked per-page demand-paging serialization) + `clear_child_tid` always-wake.
Self-test `test_fault_mutex_insert_remove` passes at boot.

### 7j. 🎉 SELF-HOSTED — the Akuma kernel compiles AND links INSIDE Akuma (June 19 2026)

**Akuma built its own kernel.** With the three fixes below stacked on §7h, the in-VM
`cargo build --release -p akuma` ran to **`Finished \`release\` profile [optimized]
target(s) in 8m 29s`** — all **147 build units**, including the `akuma(bin)` crate
itself and the final `rust-lld` link. The output on `disk_selfhost.img` at
`target/aarch64-unknown-none/release/akuma` is a valid **AArch64 ELF64 executable**
(magic `7f454c46`, `e_machine=0xB7` EM_AARCH64, `e_type=2` ET_EXEC), **3,790,560
bytes**. This is the first end-to-end self-host compile of the kernel.

**Round-trip verified — the self-built kernel BOOTS.** Extracted off
`disk_selfhost.img` host-side via the Docker loop-mount (`mount -o loop,ro` →
`cp`; the SSH-`cat` copy still truncates at ~1 MB, §7d), `rust-objcopy`'d to a flat
binary (2,958,944 bytes), and booted under QEMU/HVF: it detects the full 6144 MB,
brings up PMM/MMU/exec, reaches `[SSH Server] Listening...` in ~3 s, and answers
SSH (`uptime`, `uname -a` → `Akuma akuma 0.1.0 Akuma OS aarch64 Linux`). So:
**Akuma compiled Akuma, and the result runs.** md5s (two independent builds of the
same tree differ, as expected — in-VM nightly rustc + `-C strip=debuginfo`, no
`fs-cache`, vs the host cross-build): in-VM `58436fbc0993698b10b312917cf784b6`,
host fs-cache `f5dc8914b441d314ed1913c6912cb5cd`.

**Exact in-VM build command (copy-paste).** Run over `ssh root@vm` against a
`disk_selfhost.img` whose `/root/akuma` has the 2-line stable-parse edits applied
(see "Prerequisites" below). The in-kernel mini-shell has no env/redirection, so
`busybox env` sets up the environment and everything is passed on one line:

```sh
/bin/busybox env PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin HOME=/root CARGO_HOME=/root/.cargo \
  RUSTC=/usr/local/bin/rustc CARGO_BUILD_TARGET=aarch64-unknown-none \
  CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_UNKNOWN_NONE_RUSTFLAGS=-Clink-arg=-T/root/akuma/linker.ld \
  /usr/bin/cargo build --release -p akuma --manifest-path /root/akuma/Cargo.toml -j1
```

Why each piece:
- **`/usr/bin/cargo`** = the **apk** cargo (stable 1.96). The nightly cargo at
  `/usr/local/bin` still crashes at startup (`EC=0x0`), so apk cargo drives the build.
- **`RUSTC=/usr/local/bin/rustc`** = the **nightly** rustc — it has the
  `aarch64-unknown-none` precompiled std the kernel target needs (apk's rust only
  ships the alpine triple). So: apk cargo orchestrates, nightly rustc compiles.
- **`CARGO_BUILD_TARGET=aarch64-unknown-none`** + the linker-script
  **`...RUSTFLAGS=-Clink-arg=-T/root/akuma/linker.ld`** are passed via env because
  CWD is `/` over `ssh host cmd` (the §7 chdir bug), so `.cargo/config.toml` isn't read.
- **`busybox env PATH=… HOME=/root CARGO_HOME=/root/.cargo`** — the mini-shell can't
  set env; `busybox env` does it before `execve`.
- **`-j1`** bounds peak memory.

Prerequisites (not in the command itself):
1. **Booted kernel must carry the §7h/§7i/§7j fixes** (exit_group reorder + 128 KB
   `MAX_ARG_STRLEN` + `getpriority`) — these live in the *running* kernel, not the
   source being compiled. Without them the build walls at proc-macro2 (12/147),
   smoltcp (103/147), or the ENOSYS-as-pointer SIGSEGV.
2. **On-disk `Cargo.toml` edits** so apk's *stable* cargo parses the workspace (apply
   host-side via the Docker loop-mount; backup `Cargo.toml.selfhost-bak`): delete
   line 1 `cargo-features = ["panic-immediate-abort"]`, and change `profile.size`'s
   `panic = "immediate-abort"` → `"abort"`. (Release is `panic="abort"`, so neither
   bit is actually needed by it.)
3. **Boot with `SNAPSHOT=0 DISK=disk_selfhost.img`** so `target/` persists, and wrap
   the command in a **retry loop** (`scripts/loop_selfhost_kernelbuild.py`) to ride
   out the intermittent rustc SIGSEGV — each resume re-tries only the one crashed
   crate (rest cached). Attempt 1 happened to go straight to `Finished`.

Fixes that got from §7i's 102/147 to the finish line:
1. **argv 1 KB truncation** → `MAX_ARG_STRLEN` 128 KB + `E2BIG` (the smoltcp wall, below).
2. **`getpriority`/`setpriority` (140/141)** implemented (the ENOSYS-as-pointer crash, below).
3. **A retry loop over the incremental build.** The remaining crashes (below) are
   *intermittent*, so `scripts/loop_selfhost_kernelbuild.py` just re-runs the build;
   each resume re-tries only the one crate whose rustc SIGSEGV'd (everything else is
   cached) and continues. Attempt 1 of the loop went 104 → `Finished` in one pass
   (num-bigint-dig, which had crashed the prior run, compiled fine on retry).

**ROOT CAUSE FOUND + FIXED — the "x8 race" was a D-cache/I-cache coherency hole, not
a trap-frame race.** Symptom: a rustc rayon/codegen worker thread (tid 18/19/20)
occasionally faulted at the *same* `librustc_driver` site (`ELR=0x332461c8`) with the
*same* arg pattern (`[ptr, -4096, size, region+0x10, region_end, 0]`) but a **varying
syscall number** (seen as 141, then 70). A fixed call site issuing syscalls with a
changing `x8`, intermittently, only on worker threads — which *looked* like a stale
`x8` in the trap frame. It was not the trap-frame path (that captures `x8`
synchronously at the `svc` and the EL0 IRQ save/restore is symmetric). It was the CPU
**fetching a stale instruction** at that call site — a `mov x8, #imm` whose immediate
was wrong — so the kernel dispatched the wrong (or unimplemented) syscall → `ENOSYS` →
the `-38` was used as a pointer → `[WILD-DA]`.

- **The bug.** `MmuAddressSpace::invalidate_icache_for_page_va`
  (`crates/akuma-exec/src/mmu/mod.rs`) issued `ic ivau` **without** a preceding
  `dc cvau`. Its doc comment even claimed it "matches the `dc cvau`/`ic ivau`
  pattern used when demand-paging file-backed text" — but it only did the `ic`
  half. `ic ivau` invalidates the I-cache; the refill then reads from the Point of
  Unification. When the code bytes were freshly written **through the D-cache** —
  a `RW`→`RX` permission flip (the instruction-abort permission-fault fast path,
  `exceptions.rs` ~2915, e.g. musl applying dynamic relocations into a code page),
  or the signal-handler/restorer pages (`exceptions.rs` ~1228) — the dirty line
  may not have reached the PoU yet, so the I-cache refilled **stale** instructions.
  Nondeterministic (depends on D-cache eviction timing) and worse under
  multi-threaded load (more cache pressure), exactly matching the observed
  intermittent, worker-thread-only signature. (The *demand-paging* text path always
  did `dc cvau` + `ic ivau` correctly, which is why a first-touch fetch was fine and
  only the permission-flip / relocation path tripped.)
- **The fix.** Added `akuma_exec::mmu::sync_icache_range(kva, len)` — the full
  `dc cvau` (clean to PoU) → `dsb ish` → `ic ivau` → `dsb ish` → `isb` sequence —
  and routed `invalidate_icache_for_page_va` through it. (`mmu/mod.rs`.)
- **Regression test** (`test_icache_sync_rewrites_code`, `src/process_tests.rs`):
  identity-mapped RAM is EL1-executable (no PXN, `boot.rs` `NORMAL_BLOCK`), so the
  test writes a `movz x0,#0x1111; ret` stub into a fresh PMM page, runs
  `sync_icache_range`, calls it, then **overwrites the same page** with
  `movz x0,#0x2222; ret`, flushes, and calls again — proving the rewritten body
  executes (the rewrite-the-same-physical-line case is exactly where a missing
  `dc cvau` returns the stale `0x1111`). Verified **PASSED** at boot.
- **Status.** With the cache-maintenance fix the retry loop (§7j prerequisites) is
  belt-and-suspenders for the *other* intermittent rustc SIGSEGV class (the §7g/§7h
  multi-threaded-rustc concurrency family); the specific "varying-`x8`" crash is
  fixed at the source.

---

### 7k. Re-verifying the x8 fix in-VM + two new findings (June 21 2026)

Booted the **x8-fixed kernel** (host `cargo build --release`, the §7j cache fix in
the *running* kernel) on `disk_selfhost.img` (`MEMORY=6144 SNAPSHOT=0 INSTANCE=1`,
SSH on :2322) and drove a **clean** in-VM kernel build (`rm -rf
target/aarch64-unknown-none` first, then the §7j env-var invocation, `--offline`,
`-j1`). The boot self-test `test_icache_sync_rewrites_code` **PASSED** in the suite.

**Result on the x8 race: not reproduced.** The build blew past the old 12/147
proc-macro2 wall and reached **62/147** with **zero** occurrences of the x8-race
signature (`ELR=0x332461c8` / `FAR=0xffffffffffffffda` / varying `x8`) — confirming
the §7j `dc cvau` fix neither regresses the build nor lets the specific crash recur.
(This kernel was built **without** `fs-cache`, so it is markedly slower per crate —
every rustc spawn re-reads the toolchain off uncached ext2.)

The build then stopped on **two distinct, *non*-x8 issues**, each root-caused below.

#### 7k.1 — Build-stopping crash: a null-pointer deref in a rustc worker (the §7g/§7h residual)

`rustc` SIGSEGV'd compiling **`ppv-lite86` (62/147)**. Kernel log:
`[WILD-DA] pid=522 FAR=0x938 ELR=0x30d746a8 … x0=0x0 x19=0x0` → `Process 524
(rustc) SIGSEGV … SIGSEGV in clone_thread`. The faulting thread is a **rayon worker**
(`clone_thread`) that is *fully* set up — valid `SP_EL0`, frame pointer (`x29`),
`TPIDR_EL0` (TLS base), and call chain — so this is **not** a thread-setup failure.

Extracting `librustc_driver-*.so` from the disk image (Docker loop-mount) and mapping
`ELR=0x30d746a8` to file offset `0xc746a8` (first PT_LOAD `vaddr=0, off=0`, mmap base
`0x30100000`) decoded the faulting instruction as:

```
ldr w0, [x0, #0x938]     ; x0 = NULL  →  FAR = 0x938
```

i.e. a **null object-pointer dereference** reading a 32-bit field at offset `0x938`
(a method receiver / `&self` that should have been a valid object). This is the
documented **intermittent multi-threaded-rustc SIGSEGV residual** (§7g/§7h family),
**distinct from the x8 race** — the playbook rides it out with the retry loop
(`scripts/loop_selfhost_kernelbuild.py`): each resume re-tries only the crashed crate
(rest cached). Separating "rustc-internal startup race" from a possible kernel
stale/lost-write on a shared rayon page needs the live `GDB=1` repro (rustc ships no
debug symbols to name the function). **Still open.**

#### 7k.2 — Kernel wedge on a fault-with-IRQs-masked (FIXED)

While SSHing in to investigate (heavy `dd | base64` streaming of the 320 MB `.so` +
rapid reconnects, concurrent with the crashed process's teardown), the **SSH server
thread** took a kernel `EC=0x25` and the **whole VM wedged** (SSH dead):

```
[Exception] Sync from EL1: EC=0x25, ISS=0x4f
  ELR=0x401bf8f0 (akuma::ssh::server::run+0x58c), FAR=0x40328d78, SPSR=0x200003c5
  Thread=2, TTBR0=0x403e0000, TTBR1=0x403e0000   # kernel tables, NOT a stale user TTBR0
[SCHED] WARNING: yield_now with IRQs masked tid=2 lr=…return_to_kernel_from_fault+0x488   (forever)
```

- **The wedge mechanism (root cause + FIX).** `return_to_kernel_from_fault` ends in
  `loop { yield_now() }` to let the scheduler reap the now-terminated thread. It is
  entered from the EL1 fault-recovery pad, which ERETs with the **faulting code's
  DAIF**. The fault here happened with **IRQs masked** (`SPSR=…3c5`), so `yield_now`'s
  scheduler SGI is never delivered → the terminated thread spins forever → the entire
  box hangs (a process-local fault escalated to a VM-wide wedge). **Fix**
  (`crates/akuma-exec/src/process/mod.rs`): re-enable IRQs (`msr daifclr,#2; isb`)
  before the terminal yield loop in `return_to_kernel_from_fault` (and defensively in
  `return_to_kernel`), so a fault taken in any IRQ state still resolves to a **clean
  single-process kill**.
- **The `x29` corruption (still open).** Disassembly showed the faulting store
  `strb w11,[x29]` is an inlined `safe_print!`/UART loop: the compiler keeps the **UART
  data-register VA `0x80_0000_2000`** (device-MMIO remap, `boot.rs`) in `x29`, set once
  and reused across all four print loops in `ssh::server::run`. It was clobbered to
  `0x40328d78` = `akuma_exec::threading::check_preemption_watchdog+0xe4` — a *return
  address on the yield/preempt path* (the fingerprint of an `x29`/`x30` save-restore
  edge or kernel-stack pressure). Both standard switch paths (`switch_context`,
  `irq_handler`) preserve `x29` symmetrically on inspection, so this is a rarer edge,
  most plausibly kernel-stack pressure in the SSH data path under the abnormal
  concurrent streaming load. The §7k.2 wedge fix means even a recurrence no longer
  hangs the box; pinning the corruption source needs the live repro.

#### 7k.3 — ROOT CAUSE of the intermittent rustc SIGSEGV: a per-process signal mask (FIXED June 22 2026)

The §7k.1 worker-thread corruption was run to ground. **First a full self-host build
was achieved**: with the icache (§7j) + wedge (§7k.2) fixes, `cargo build -p akuma`
completed **147/147** in-VM via the retry loop (62 → 121 → `Finished`), riding out the
intermittent crashes. Then the intermittent crash itself was root-caused.

**Experiments that narrowed it (single-vCPU HVF):**
- **Stack overflow — RULED OUT.** Bumping kernel stacks to **512 KB** (system + user)
  did *not* stop the crash (recurred at crate 63 of a clean build). It *did* surface a
  real **stack-size inversion oversight**: the full-capability `release` profile had a
  *smaller* system-thread stack (64 KB) than `size` (128 KB) and `extreme` (96 KB).
  **Fixed** — release is now the most generously provisioned (512 KB system + user),
  with a regression self-test `test_kernel_stack_sizes_sane` (`src/process_tests.rs`).
- **A missing / zero-returning syscall — RULED OUT.** Disassembly of the crash sites
  showed the bad value is a *corrupted register*, not a syscall return: e.g. a real
  `futex(uaddr, op=0xffffffff, …)` (kernel: `[futex] unsupported op=-1` → `ENOSYS`),
  where *only the `op` register `x1`* is garbage; uaddr/val/timeout/uaddr2 are valid.
  The syscall log shows `mmap`/`munmap`/`futex` all succeeding around the crash.
- **The x8/icache race — did not recur** (the §7j fix held across ~600 crate-compiles).

**Root cause: the signal mask was per-process, not per-thread.** `Process::signal_mask`
is a single field, and `read_current_pid()` collapses every CLONE_THREAD sibling onto
the **owner PID** — so **all sibling threads shared one signal mask**. The in-VM rustc
build fires a **SIGUSR1 storm (~10,400 `tkill(sig=10)` per build)** at its worker/
codegen threads and uses *per-thread* masking to gate those signals to safe points.
With a shared mask, one sibling's `rt_sigprocmask` / `sigreturn` (which restored
`uc_sigmask` into the shared field) **cleared the SIGUSR1 block another sibling had
installed** → SIGUSR1 delivered mid-critical-section / between `mov x1,#op` and `svc` →
the sigframe save/restore around that unsafe point **corrupted a single register**
(`x0`→0, futex `op`/`x1`→`0xffffffff`, `x0`→`-38` used as a pointer). This is the
long-documented-but-never-confirmed **signal/register-corruption** bug
(`docs/SIGNAL_DELIVERY_FORKTEST_EVIDENCE.md` §D) — the flaky Go forktest never pinned
it; the rustc self-host build, with its steady high signal volume, reproduces it
~1/build.

**Attempted fix (per-thread signal mask) — DID NOT resolve the corruption.** Made the
signal mask **per-thread** (`THREAD_SIGNAL_MASK[MAX_THREADS]` keyed by
`current_thread_id()`); delivery, `rt_sigprocmask`, `sigreturn`, and `tkill` all use it;
reset on thread-slot recycle; seeded from the parent on `clone(CLONE_THREAD)`. Builds +
clippy clean; all boot signal self-tests pass; new host unit tests
`per_thread_masks_are_independent` / `signal_mask_out_of_range_is_zero` pass. **This is a
genuine POSIX-correctness fix and is kept — but the in-VM validation build STILL crashed**
(at crate 54/147, `[WILD-DA] FAR=0x0 x0=0x0 x1=0xfffffffffffff000 ELR=0x332461c8`, the
original §7j site, arg pattern `[0,-4096,size,region,region_end,0]`). So the shared
signal mask was **not** the (sole) root cause. The corruption persists at the same
~1/build rate. **STILL OPEN** — see the hand-off in §7k.4.

#### 7k.4 — HAND-OFF: the intermittent rustc register corruption (STILL OPEN, June 22 2026)

State for the next session. **The full self-host build works** (147/147 via the retry
loop); this is about eliminating the intermittent ~1/build crash so the build completes
in a single pass.

**The bug, precisely.** In a rustc worker/LTO `clone_thread`, intermittently (~1 per
147-unit build, single-vCPU HVF), **a single register that should hold a valid pointer
holds garbage**, and the next instruction uses it → `[WILD-DA]`. Confirmed
manifestations (all in `librustc_driver`, all `last_sc` idle = not in a syscall):
| crate/site | FAR | bad reg | source of the bad value (from disasm) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x332461c8` (the §7j site) | `0x0` | `x0=0` | `x0` = return of `bl 0x33c804c8`; then `str x1,[x0]` |
| LTO cgu (`0x32ab64a8`) | `-38` | `x0=-38` | `x0` = return of `bl 0x33c804c8`; then `str w1,[x0]` |
| ppv-lite86 (`0x30d746a8`) | `0x938` | `x0=0` | `x0` = a method `&self` arg passed valid by caller |
| LTO cgu (`0x33a6a884`) | `-0xfe8` | `x0=-4096` | `x0` = `ldr [x7,#0x10]` (heap entry held -4096) |
| futex (`sync.rs`) | `-38` | `x1=0xffffffff` | futex `op` arg garbage → `ENOSYS` → used as ptr |

**`0x33c804c8` is a recurring suspect** — an alloc-like `librustc_driver` function
(called `(x19, 8)`) that returns the bad `x0` in two of the crashes. Worth resolving
its symbol (needs rustc debug info, which the shipped `.so` lacks) or single-stepping it
under lldb.

**Ruled out (with evidence):**
- **Stack overflow** — recurs at 512 KB stacks (§7k.3). [Side fix kept: the release
  system-stack was *smaller* than extreme's — inversion corrected, release now 512 KB.]
- **Missing/zero-returning syscall** — the futex *fails because its arg is corrupt*;
  `mmap`/`munmap`/`futex` all succeed in the syscall log around each crash.
- **Per-process signal mask** — made it per-thread (§7k.3); crash still recurs. (Kept as
  a correctness fix; **not** the root cause.)
- **The §7j icache/x8 story for `0x332461c8` looks like a misdiagnosis** — that site is
  `str x1,[x0]` where `x0` is a *function return*, not a stale `mov x8` immediate; the
  icache `dc cvau` fix (§7j, real & kept) did not stop this site recurring.

**Leading remaining hypotheses (for the new session):**
1. **Register save/restore corruption across preemption** — a single GPR is wrong after
   a context switch / signal-frame round-trip. Audit: the EL0 IRQ frame (`irq_el0_handler`),
   `switch_context`, and the sigframe save/restore (`try_deliver_signal`/`do_rt_sigreturn`)
   under the SIGUSR1 storm. The shapes (errno-/page-mask-/null-valued single regs) and the
   documented `SIGNAL_DELIVERY_FORKTEST_EVIDENCE.md` all point here, but the obvious paths
   look symmetric on inspection — needs a **live catch**.
2. **A kernel write corrupting a shared rustc heap structure** (the `0x33c804c8` allocator's
   state), so it returns null/garbage. Single-vCPU rules out SMP visibility; suspect a
   demand-paging / page-management edge under the heavy mmap/munmap churn.

**How to reproduce + catch it (recipe):**
- Boot the fixed kernel: `INSTANCE=1 GDB=1 MEMORY=6144M SNAPSHOT=0 DISK=disk_selfhost.img
  cargo run --release` (gdbstub :1235, ssh :2322). `caffeinate -dimsu` to stop host sleep.
- Drive clean builds in a loop (`/tmp/sh_batch.py N`, or `scripts/loop_selfhost_kernelbuild.py`);
  ~1 crash per build. Kernel serial → `logs/selfhost_*_boot.log`.
- **Diagnostics already in the tree** (rare-path only, keep): `[futex-diag]` (sync.rs, dumps
  the user `svc`+`mov` stream on a corrupt futex op) and `[WILD-DA-diag]` (exceptions.rs,
  dumps `insn@elr`/`insn@elr-4` + **`PREV-IS-SVC`** flag on an errno-shaped WILD-DA). NOTE
  they DON'T fire on `FAR=0x0` (plain null deref, the `0x332461c8` variant) — **broaden the
  WILD-DA-diag trigger to any small-|FAR| (e.g. `|far| < 0x10000`), not just `-200..0`.**
- Best next experiment: boot `GDB=1`, set an lldb breakpoint on the fatal-EL0-DA path
  (`maybe_print_sigsegv_syscall_diag` / the `[WILD-DA]` site) so the guest freezes *before*
  the process is reaped, then read the faulting thread's full register file + walk back to
  where the bad reg was produced; and inspect `0x33c804c8`'s state.

**Side observation to investigate later:** `logs/selfhost_maskfix_boot.log` shows **~6,132
`[EINVAL] nr=78` (readlinkat) at libc PC `0x30069828`, `args[0]=AT_FDCWD`** — the §7g.1
"path isn't a symlink → EINVAL" red herring, but the *volume* (a tight loop) is suspicious;
confirm it's benign vs a path-resolution retry storm (wasted work each build).

**Committed/kept this session:** icache `dc cvau` fix (§7j/§7k) + test; EL1 fault-recovery
IRQ-enable wedge fix (§7k.2) + test; release kernel-stack-inversion fix (§7k.3) + test;
per-thread signal mask (POSIX-correct, not the root cause) + tests; the two diagnostics.
**Tooling:** `/tmp/sh_batch.py` (clean-build loop + tally), `logs/batch_tally.txt`,
`/tmp/akuma_extract/lrd.so` (extracted `librustc_driver` for disasm; offsets = VA − 0x30100000).

#### 7k.5 — pthread / threading-API conformance suite + API non-compliances (June 22 2026)

Built the dedicated threading/signal-API conformance test set the §7 TODO called for
(it's why §7k.3 went undetected so long: nothing exercised the API the way rustc/rayon
do). New boot self-test module **`src/pthread_tests.rs`** (18 tests + a known-gaps
report), wired into the boot suite right after `sync_tests` (`src/main.rs`). All 18
PASS and the kernel boots clean through to SSH at **both 512 MB and 6 GB**
(`logs/selfhost_revert_boot.log`, release). These call `handle_syscall(..)` directly
with `BYPASS_VALIDATION` (like `sync_tests`) and `assert!` so a regression halts the boot.

> **The 6 GB run caught a real test bug.** The EFAULT sub-tests originally used a fixed
> low "bad pointer" (`0xdead_0000` ≈ 3.7 GB) — fine at 512 MB (above RAM) but **inside
> the identity-mapped RAM at ≥4 GB**, so `validate_user_ptr` saw it as mapped and the
> test halted the boot at 6 GB. Fixed to use the top of the user VA range
> (`user_va_limit_value() - 0x1000`), which is unmapped at any RAM size. Lesson: boot
> self-tests run on the self-host VM, so they must be RAM-size-independent.

**Coverage (kernel-testable subset):**
- **rt_sigprocmask** — BLOCK/UNBLOCK/SETMASK semantics; SIGKILL/SIGSTOP unblockable;
  validation (sigsetsize≠8, bad `how`, EFAULT).
- **Per-thread signal mask (the §7k.3 class)** — sibling independence;
  `test_sibling_unblock_does_not_clear_my_block` reproduces the exact §7k.3 scenario at
  the syscall layer (would fail on the old shared-mask code); fresh-slot starts empty;
  clone-seed inheritance (`seed_thread_signal_mask`, the path `src/syscall/proc.rs` uses).
- **Pending delivery** — `tkill`/`tgkill` target the right slot; mask honoured;
  SIGKILL/SIGSTOP bypass it; lowest-numbered first; blocked-fatal pends not drops;
  MAX_SIGNALS=64 boundary (sig 64 accepted, 65 → EINVAL).
- **sigaltstack** — default-disabled, set/get round-trip, min-size ENOMEM, per-thread isolation.
- **Identity/validation** — `gettid` uniqueness (and == `current_thread_id`);
  `rt_sigaction` rejects 0/SIGKILL/SIGSTOP/>64; `rt_sigtimedwait` sigsetsize check.

**On `MAX_SIGNALS` (it's 64 — the *count* is correct and consistent):** Linux has 64
signals; the action table is `[SignalAction; 64]`, masks/pending are `u64`, `sigsetsize`
is `==8`, bounds checks use `sig > MAX_SIGNALS` with `1<<(sig-1)` everywhere (no `<<sig`
overflow, no under-sized array). The boundary is guarded by the two tests above. Where
signal handling **does** drop the ball is *not* the cardinality:

**API non-compliances found — 2 FIXED, 1 REVERTED (it broke the self-host build!), 1 open:**
1. **No RT-signal queue (STILL OPEN — it's a feature, not a small fix).**
   `PENDING_SIGNALS[tid]` is a single per-thread `AtomicU64` *bitset*. POSIX real-time
   signals (SIGRTMIN..MAX = 34–64) must **queue** — multiple instances of the same number,
   each with a siginfo payload. Akuma **coalesces** them to one bit and carries no siginfo
   (verified: two `pend(40)` → one `take`). Implementing it means a per-thread (signo,
   siginfo) queue + `rt_sigqueueinfo`/`sigwaitinfo` plumbing + a delivery-path change; no
   current consumer needs it (rustc doesn't), so it's deferred to a dedicated pass with a
   userspace `sigqueue` test. Still reported as `[GAP ]` at boot.
2. **`signal_is_fatal_default` disposition — TRIED, then REVERTED (it broke the self-host
   build).** Linux's disposition table says SIGUSR1(10), SIGUSR2(12), SIGSTKFLT(16),
   SIGIO(29), SIGPWR(30) and the RT signals (32–64) terminate by default, so I added them.
   **Running the in-VM kernel build then killed rustc with `signal: 10` at unit 146/147,
   reproducibly.** Root cause: the rustc self-host build *storms* SIGUSR1 (~10,400
   `tkill(sig=10)`), and Akuma's `tkill` falls back to a `Default` disposition whenever it
   can't attribute the target tid to a process — so a *fatal* default on a stormed signal
   kills the build. The §7k.3 doc's aside ("doesn't bite rustc — it installs handlers") is
   **wrong**, and the original conservative table was load-bearing, not an oversight.
   **Reverted** `signal_is_fatal_default` to the original set with a comment recording why.
   The POSIX-correct fix belongs in `tkill`'s handler *attribution* (don't apply fatal-Default
   to a signal whose target you can't resolve), not in the disposition table — left for a
   future pass. (musl/pthreads similarly storm SIGRTMIN for cancellation/timers, so the RT
   additions were unsafe for the same reason.) This is the session's headline finding.
3. **`rt_sigsuspend` — FIXED** (was `=> 0` stub in `src/syscall/mod.rs`; now
   `signal::sys_rt_sigsuspend`). Installs the suspend mask, blocks until a signal not
   blocked by it is pending, and returns −EINTR (never 0). Restores the *pre-suspend* mask
   via a new per-thread **restore-sigmask** mechanism (Linux `TIF_RESTORE_SIGMASK`
   analogue: `threading::set_restore_sigmask`/`take_restore_sigmask`, consumed at the single
   `uc_sigmask` write in `exceptions.rs::try_deliver_signal` so `rt_sigreturn` restores the
   original; reset on slot recycle). Guards: `test_rt_sigsuspend_validation`,
   `test_rt_sigsuspend_blocks_then_eintr` (asserts it actually blocks, then wakes on a pend
   and returns −EINTR).
4. **`tgkill` ignores `tgid` — FIXED** (`src/syscall/signal.rs`). Now returns `ESRCH` when
   `tid` names a live thread whose `proc.tgid` ≠ the requested `tgid` (prevents mis-delivery
   to a recycled tid living in a different process); falls through to `tkill` for kernel
   threads with no owning process (unchanged best-effort). The cross-group ESRCH path needs
   two real processes to exercise, so it's covered by review + the userspace half, not a
   boot test.

Minor/adjacent (noted, not yet addressed): `tkill` prints `[signal] tkill(...)`
unconditionally (~10.4k/build of noise on the hot path); `setitimer` is a stub returning 0;
`pend_signal_for_thread`'s doc comment says "overwrites / only one pending" but the code
ORs a 64-bit set (stale comment).

**In-VM self-host compile re-verified on the gap-fixed kernel (clean single pass).** After
the gap-2 revert, booted the rebuilt kernel on `disk_selfhost.img` (release, `INSTANCE=1
SNAPSHOT=0 MEMORY=6144M`) and rebuilt the **`akuma` kernel crate itself** in-VM (apk cargo
1.96 + nightly `rustc`, the §7e env-var invocation, `scripts/loop_selfhost_kernelbuild.py`):

```
[attempt 1] *** FINISHED at 146/147 ***
    Finished `release` profile [optimized] target(s) in 2m 13s
```

`/root/akuma/target/aarch64-unknown-none/release/akuma` = a valid AArch64 ELF
(`7f 45 4c 46 02 01`…), 3,790,560 bytes — linked **on attempt 1, no crash, no retry**.
Two notes from the run: (a) the `akuma`-crate fat-LTO that an earlier *stuck* prior-session
process appeared to "wedge" in `munmap` for ~1 h was that one process's state, **not** a
kernel bug — the fresh kernel ran the same LTO cleanly in ~2 min; (b) the §7k.4 intermittent
register-corruption SIGSEGV did **not** recur this pass (it only re-paged the final crate;
the dep compiles where it usually fires were cached — so this is not evidence it's gone).
Boot/build logs: `logs/selfhost_revert_boot.log`, `logs/loopbuild_1.log`.

**Next (userspace half of the suite):** the register-integrity-under-signal-storm check
and handler/`sigreturn` round-trips need a real process — build them as `userspace/forktest`
additions or a `userspace/pthread_suite` (the doc's "ALL PASSED / exit 0" binary). That's
where the §7k.4 intermittent register-corruption bug should be cornered, since it only
manifests under real userspace async delivery at arbitrary PCs.

### 7i. §7h fix breaks the proc-macro2 wall; kernel build reaches **102/147** (June 19 2026)

With the §7h `exit_group` reaping-order fix in the booted kernel, the in-VM
**kernel** `cargo build --release -p akuma` (apk cargo 1.96 + `RUSTC=`nightly, the
§7e env-var invocation, `MEMORY=6144 DISK=disk_selfhost.img`, fs-cache) blew clean
**past the old proc-macro2 deadlock** (which used to wedge forever at unit 12/147)
and compiled **102 of 147 build units in ~9 min with zero hangs or crashes** —
every proc-macro/derive crate (`proc-macro2`, `quote`, `syn`, `zerocopy-derive`,
`der_derive`) plus the whole crypto/SSH stack (`curve25519-dalek`, `ecdsa`, `rsa`,
`ed25519-dalek`, `crypto-bigint`, …). This is the **furthest the kernel self-host
build has ever reached** and confirms §7h was THE proc-macro2 blocker.

It then hit two *new* walls, both now fixed:

**(a) `smoltcp` build script — argv truncated at 1 KB (FIXED).** Unit 103/147
(`smoltcp(build.rs)`) failed with `error: Argument to option 'check-cfg' missing`.
Root cause: the kernel's `execve` copied each argv string with a **1024-byte cap**
(`copy_from_user_str(str_ptr, 1024)` in `sys_execve`) and, on a string that
exceeded it, **`break`d the argv loop — silently dropping that arg AND every arg
after it**, then exec'd a corrupt argv. smoltcp's build script passes a single
`--check-cfg 'cfg(feature, values(...))'` argument ~5 KB long (every smoltcp
feature listed), so rustc received a dangling `--check-cfg` with its value and all
trailing flags gone. Fix: a profile-gated `config::MAX_ARG_STRLEN` (**128 KB in
release** = Linux `MAX_ARG_STRLEN`; 8 KB size / 4 KB extreme) used for argv+envp,
and `sys_execve` now **fails the whole exec with `E2BIG`** on an over-long arg
instead of silently truncating (`src/config.rs`, `src/syscall/proc.rs`,
`src/syscall/mod.rs` adds `E2BIG`).

**(b) `getpriority` (syscall 141) unimplemented → ENOSYS-used-as-pointer SIGSEGV
(intermittent).** On a re-run, a `curve25519-dalek` rustc (pid 647, in
`librustc_driver` at `ELR=0x332461c8`) called **syscall 141 (`getpriority`)**,
which fell through to the catch-all `ENOSYS` branch; the `-38` return was then used
as a pointer (`FAR=0xffffffffffffffda`) → `[WILD-DA]` data abort, killing that build
unit (and dropping the SSH session). **Intermittent** — rustc's rayon/threadpool
calls it opportunistically, so the first run reached 102/147 without tripping it.
Fix: implement `getpriority`/`setpriority` (return benign success) so the call can't
ENOSYS-crash a build unit.

**Build mechanics learned this session:** boot with **`SNAPSHOT=0`** (not the
INSTANCE>0 default) so the build's `target/` persists on `disk_selfhost.img` across
kernel iterations — each reboot then resumes the build incrementally instead of
recompiling all ~100 deps from scratch (~9 min). The SSH-streamed build survives the
whole compile (§5 fix); a dropped session leaves the build killed (not orphaned)
when a build-unit rustc SIGSEGVs.

**Next:** with both walls fixed, resume the incremental build and push past
`smoltcp` → `embedded-tls` → the `akuma` kernel crate itself + the final link.

---

## 8. Other known issues

- **Intermittent kernel crash during exec at high RAM.** Once, during an
  interactive 16 GB session with concurrent herd/httpd activity, exec'ing rustc
  wild-jumped into the `BLOCK_DEVICE` static (`.bss`) — `EC=0x0` undefined-instr,
  `ELR` in data. **Not reproducible** in isolation (10/10 repeat execs clean at
  16 GB; `rustc --version` clean at every size). Filed as a rare
  concurrency/corruption bug, not a RAM ceiling. (`11_selfhost.log`.)
