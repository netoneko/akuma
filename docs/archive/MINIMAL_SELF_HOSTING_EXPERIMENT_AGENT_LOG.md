# Minimal self-hosting kernel "Taoxichuan" — agent log

**Status: in progress. Started 2026-10-24.**

Running log for the two-agent execution of
[`MINIMAL_SELF_HOSTING_EXPERIMENT.md`](MINIMAL_SELF_HOSTING_EXPERIMENT.md).
The minimal kernel being composed is named **Taoxichuan**.

**Oversight change (2026-10-24, afternoon).** The host track and the babysitting
of goose-glm were first run by Kimi (Crush, `k3-256k`). Kimi ran out of tokens
because of a bad subscription setting on the owner's side — not a model failure.
Oversight moved to **Claude Sonnet 5 (Claude Code)**, which takes over the host
track and supervises goose. The metal track is unchanged: still goose + GLM on
the ryzen. The tracks below still say "Kimi/Crush" for what was done before the
handover; entries after it are marked *(Sonnet)*. Note for the open-weights
claim: the host track is no longer open-weights from this point; the metal
track still is.

Working rules carried over from the owner's last Crush session (the "wisdom"):

1. Every stage is a **separate goose prompt** (new ACP session); help it when
   stuck, but let it finish with KVM verification.
2. The new kernel gets a **new source tree** — a named thing in the repo, not
   only a filename on a binary. Each track records which shape it chose and why.
3. Sync through **GitHub** (host pushes `origin`, ryzen pushes `litter`), not
   bundles; reconcile the two tracks' changes into one kernel.
4. Say honestly **who built what** (host vs goose) in this log.
5. Document the process here as it goes; hypervisor disagreements are findings.
6. Agents' shells need `HOME=/root` (ssh does not set it; git and logs depend on it).

Tracks:

- **Host track (Kimi/Crush on the Mac)**: builds the same kernel, verifies
  under Firecracker in the Lima VM `fc`. Commits on `rust-org-il-experiment`,
  pushes to `origin`.
- **Metal track (goose-glm on the ryzen, ACP server on :3284)**: builds and
  tests under Akuma's own KVM (`/dev/kvm0`, herd `vm-dev` pattern). Commits on
  its own branches, pushes to the `litter` remote only. Each stage is a
  separate goose prompt (new ACP session per stage).

A stage counts when BOTH tracks pass its gate. Hypervisor disagreements are
findings, recorded here, not averaged away.

## Environment baseline (verified 2026-10-24)

- Box checkout `/src/github.com/netoneko/akuma` on `rust-org-il-experiment`
  @ f8dd945f, experiment doc present. Dirty submodules
  (`userspace/rumpkernel/src-netbsd`, `userspace/tcc/tinycc`) and untracked
  `root/`, `rustc-ice-*.txt` — pre-existing, left alone.
- ACP probe from Mac: `pong` / `end_turn` against
  `http://192.168.1.159:3284/acp`; `/health` 200.
- Lima `fc` VM on the Mac: Running (vz, aarch64, 4 CPU, 8 GiB).

## Stage log

### Stage 1 — boot in KVM (gate: init spawn, banner, zero [Fault]/PANIC/[sig!])

- 2026-10-24 host track: brief prepared, sent to goose as ACP session
  (see below). Firecracker/Lima host-track setup in progress.

- 2026-10-24 *(Sonnet)*: handover. State found: goose-glm is 25+ min into the
  stage-1 turn, reading only (surveying `amd64/src` vs the crate tree), box on
  `taoxichuan-s1` @ 96b3585c, no commits, no `RESULT.md`. Kimi's host-track
  claims (aarch64 stage 1 PASS under Firecracker, an `init-script` stage-2 prep
  in `akuma-config` / `akuma-kernel-glue`, `taoxichuan-fc.bin`) are **not in the
  tree** (uncommitted, lost with the session): treated as unverified and to be
  redone, not as a pass.

(Entries append below this line, newest stage last.)
