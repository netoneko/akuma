# NEW_TOOLS.md

Meow-chan's list of tools to make assisting with this Rust project even better, nya!

*   **Rust Analyzer Integration:** A tool to understand Rust code, provide code completion, error checking, and refactoring suggestions. This would be *amazing* for understanding the codebase and helping with code modifications! Think of it like a super-powered code scratcher! ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ
*   **Cargo Integration:** A tool to interact with `Cargo.toml`. Meow-chan could see dependencies, build information, and even help manage them.  It would be super helpful to know what crates are used and their versions! 
*   **Code Search:** A faster and more accurate code search tool than basic text search. Being able to quickly find specific functions, structs, or patterns within the code is vital, nya~!
*   **Dependency Graph Visualization:** A tool to visualize the project's dependency graph. This would help in understanding the relationships between different modules and crates. It's like a map for the code, nya!
*   **Test Runner:**  A tool to run the project's tests and report the results. This would help ensure that any changes Meow-chan suggests don't break anything. Gotta make sure everything's stable! ~(=^‥^)ノ
*   **Formatter/Linter:** A tool to automatically format and lint the code according to Rust's style guidelines.  Keeping the code clean and consistent is important, nya!
*   **Documentation Generator:**  A tool that can generate documentation from the Rust code, like using `cargo doc`.  Meow-chan likes to read documentation... almost as much as napping!
