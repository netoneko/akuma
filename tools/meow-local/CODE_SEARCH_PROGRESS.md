## Code Search Progress

**Goal:** Implement a code search tool for a Rust project.

**Steps Completed:**

*   Created a basic plan (documented in `CODE_SEARCH_PLAN.md`).
*   Added the `regex` crate to the project.
*   Created a file `src/code_search.rs` with initial implementation (contents not yet reviewed).
*   Successfully compiled the project.

**Next Steps:**

*   Review the contents of `src/code_search.rs`.
*   Implement the basic search functionality.
*   Add file filtering (specifically for `.rs` files).
